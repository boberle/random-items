# Random Items: data for randomitems.io

This repository contains random items extracted from Wikipedia.  These items can be used to fill-in a mock database or web site, or for testing purpose.  These data are used to feed my website [radomitems.io](https://randomitems.io).

The data are available as CSV files.

## Description

The data are organized into tables that model real world objects, like a user profile (with name, address, e-mail, gender, etc.), a company (name, logo, country, web site url, number of employees, etc.), a battle (name, date, description, etc.), and so on.

Fields contain either short information (name, date, address, author, latitude, longitude,...), url to pictures hosted on Wikimedia servers (photos, maps, flags...), or longer texts like whole Wikipedia pages in plain text (wiki syntax) or html format.

The data are extracted from Wikipedia, so they are (mostly) consistent:

- Some data are entirely extracted from the Wikipedia data, like companies, countries, cities, lakes, etc.  This means that the entire row contains real data: the name, the picture (photo, logo, flag), the location (latitude, longitude), the population, etc.
- In other cases, some data are consistent and real (the name of a person will match with their gender, country of birth, picture, etc.) while other are faked (e-mails, addresses, phone numbers, etc.).

For some tables, a Wikipedia ID is provided, so you can link to the original Wikipedia page.

## Disclaimer

These data are designed to be used as fill-in data, for mock databases and websites or to test a setup with example data.  Even if they are extracted from Wikipedia and so represent some state of the real world, they are not meant as a source of information.  Some of these data are plainly incorrect, either because they have been faked (addresses, e-mails, etc.) or because the information found on Wikipedia was not correct or it has been badly retrieved.
