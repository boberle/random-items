Aston Martin Racing adapted the DB9 for sports car racing, producing the DBR9 for FIA GT1 and the DBRS9 for FIA GT3. These two cars are modified DB9 models adapted for motorsport; the interior features are removed and the aluminium body panels are replaced by carbon fibre panels. Additionally, the engine has been tweaked in both the cars to produce more horsepower and torque.
Production of the DB9 ended after 12 years in 2016, having been replaced by the DB11 which uses an all-new platform and engine.",00024.jpg,00024.jpg

The X5 made its debut in 1999. It was BMW's first SUV and it also featured all-wheel drive and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. In 2006, the second generation X5 was launched, known internally as the E70. Introduced in the facelift version of the E53, the E70 also featured the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to an automatic transmission. In 2009, the X5 M performance variant was released as a 2010 model.BMW branded the X5 as a Sport Activity Vehicle (SAV) rather than an SUV, to emphasize its on-road ability despite its size.  Like the Lexus RX 300, the X5 heralded the shift from light truck-based body-on-frame SUVs to crossovers underpinned by unibody car platforms that would come to fruition in the late 2000s. Among German luxury automakers, while the Mercedes-Benz M-Class had beaten the X5 to the market by a year, the X5 was the first to use a unibody chassis whereas the M-Class used a light truck platform until its second generation. While the Lexus RX is based on the Toyota Camry mass market sedan, the X5 shares its underpinnings with the BMW 5 Series performance luxury sedan.X5s are manufactured in Greer, South Carolina at the Spartanburg BMW plant and modified for armoured, security versions in Mexico at the BMW de México Toluca plant. Since July 2009, some assembly operations are also performed in Kaliningrad, Russia by Avtotor.
Starting with the X5, BMW's ""SAV"" series has since expanded with derivatives of other BMW number-series models, first in 2003 with the BMW X3 compact luxury crossover, and then in 2008 with the BMW X6 midsize coupe luxury crossover which shares its platform with the X5.",00052.jpg,00052.jpg

Until December 2018, the Volt/Ampera family of vehicles was the world's all-time best-selling plug-in hybrid vehicle. As of December 2019, the Chevrolet Volt is listed as the all-time top-selling plug-in hybrid in the American market.The Volt operates as a pure battery electric vehicle until its battery capacity drops to a predetermined threshold from full charge. From there, its internal combustion engine powers an electric generator to extend the vehicle's range as needed. When the engine is running it may be periodically mechanically linked (by a clutch) to a planetary gear set, and hence the output drive axle, to improve energy efficiency. The Volt's regenerative braking also contributes to the on-board electricity generation. Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cycle, the 2013/15 model year Volt all-electric range is 38 mi (61 km), with a combined electric mode/gasoline-only rating of 62 mpg‑US (3.8 L/100 km; 74 mpg‑imp) equivalent (MPG-equivalent).
The second-generation Volt's improved battery system and drivetrain increased the all-electric range to 53 miles (85 km), its EPA-rated fuel economy in charge-sustaining mode to 42 mpg‑US (5.6 L/100 km; 50 mpg‑imp), and the combined city/highway fuel economy in all-electric mode to 106 MPG-e, up from 98 MPG-e. Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. and Canada began in October 2015 as a 2016 model year.
The Volt has won several awards, including the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green Car of the Year, 2011 North American Car of the Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European Car of the Year, and 2016 Green Car of the Year.",00109.jpg,00109.jpg

Together, the 4007 and C-Crosser were the first Japanese produced cars sold under any French brand. They had been planned to be assembled, for Europe, in the factory that was built in the 1960s to assemble DAFs, now Mitsubishi's Nedcar plant in Born, Netherlands, but this was postponed indefinitely, due to slow sales of the models.From 2011, they were assembled at the Russian PSA Peugeot Citroën/Mitsubishi joint venture factory in Kaluga.

It was officially launched internationally in March 2011, but already on sale in some countries by the end of 2010. Based upon the Citroën C4 II, it features raised suspension to resemble a compact SUV and repositioned door handles to give a coupé like silhouette. 
The rear windows are fixed, and do not slide down or open outwards.At launch, the petrol engines that powered the DS 4 were all a product of a collaboration between PSA and BMW, all being 1,598 cc four cylinder, 16 valve units. The base VTi 120 was normally aspirated and put out 120 PS (88 kW). As its name implies it came with variable valve timing. The next engine up was the THP 155, essentially a turbo charged version of the VTi. 
It put out 156 PS (115 kW) thanks to a twin scroll turbocharger and dual overhead cams, and used a six speed manual transmission. The most powerful engine option was the THP 200, a variation of the THP 155, but with an output of 200 PS (147 kW). Citroën initially offered two diesel engines in the DS 4 – the HDi 110, a 1,560 cc four cylinder that put out 112 PS (82 kW) and the four cylinder HDi 160 also found in the sedan Citroën C5. 
It has a displacement of 1,997 cc and put out 163 PS (120 kW).
The current engine line up differs significantly. The DS 4 is available with Start&Stop technology and Citroën says that the battery has been optimised to withstand up to 600,000 starting cycles. The boot is 385 litres or 1021 litres with the back seats folded down. The DS 4's styling has been very well received by the international press.
It was elected Most Beautiful Car of the Year at the International Automobile Festival, beating BMW’s new F10 5 Series and Honda's new CR-Z hybrid car. German magazine Auto Bild, and its partner magazines throughout Europe, have given it first prize for design, in its category in the contest Design Award.

The successor to the Ford LTD Crown Victoria, two generations of the model line were produced from the 1992 to 2012 model years.

The Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (1992–2011) was marketed specifically for law-enforcement use; a long-wheelbase Crown Victoria sedan (2002–2011) was marketed primarily for taxi cab fleets.     
The Crown Victoria was produced on the rear-wheel-drive Ford Panther platform, sharing its chassis with the Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car.  From 1997 until their 2011 discontinuation, the three model lines were the sole four-door sedans produced in North America with a full-length frame, rear-wheel drive, and a standard V8 engine.   
For its entire production, the Crown Victoria was produced by Ford Canada alongside the Grand Marquis at St. Thomas Assembly in Southwold, Ontario, Canada.  From 1991 to 2011, over 1.5 million examples (including Police Interceptors) were produced by St. Thomas Assembly prior to its closure.  A 2012 Crown Victoria (intended for Middle East export) was the final vehicle produced by the facility.  Following the discontinuation of the model line, the Crown Victoria was not directly replaced, with the full-size Ford Taurus serving as the next basis for Ford police cars.",00175.jpg,00175.jpg

From the 2006 through 2020 model years, two generations of the Fusion have been produced in gasoline, gas/electric hybrid, and gas/plug-in electric hybrid variants. The Fusion was manufactured at Ford's Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly plant in Sonora, Mexico, alongside its rebadged variant the Lincoln MKZ, and formerly the Mercury Milan, both of which share its CD3 platform.
Production on the first Fusions began on August 1, 2005. The Fusion replaced the Mondeo for the Latin American markets—except in Argentina (where the current European Mondeo is available) and in the United States and Canada (where it superseded the then mid-size Taurus and the compact Contour). The Fusion is positioned between the compact Ford Focus and the full-size Ford Taurus. In the Middle East, this model is sold alongside the Mondeo. Versions sold there are available only with the 2.5-liter engine. Unlike in the United States, Canada, and Latin America, no V6 engine is available in that region.  The same is true in South Korea, where only the 2.5-liter engines (including those for the hybrid model) are available as of the 2012 model year.

The Accord nameplate has been applied to a variety of vehicles worldwide, including coupes, station wagons, hatchbacks and a Honda Crosstour crossover.
Since initiation, Honda has offered several different car body styles and versions of the Accord, and often vehicles marketed under the Accord nameplate concurrently in different regions differ quite substantially. It debuted in 1976, as a compact hatchback, though this style only lasted through 1989, as the lineup was expanded to include a sedan, coupe and wagon. By the sixth-generation Accord at the end of the 1990s, it evolved into an intermediate vehicle, with one basic platform but with different bodies and proportions to increase its competitiveness against its rivals in different international markets. For the eighth-generation Accord released for the North American market in 2007, Honda had again chosen to move the model further upscale and increase its size. This pushed the Accord sedan from the upper limit of what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines as a mid-size car to just above the lower limit of a full-size car, with the coupe still rated as a mid-size car. In 2012, the ninth-generation Accord sedan, with smaller exterior dimensions, was once again classified as a mid-size car at 119 cubic feet (3.4 m3), falling just shy of the ""Large Car"" classification. However, the tenth-generation Accord sedan, with similar exterior dimensions, returned to full-size car status with its combined interior space of 123 cubic feet (3.5 m3); the coupe was discontinued in 2017.
In 1982, the Accord became the first car from a Japanese manufacturer to be produced in the United States when production commenced in Marysville, Ohio at Honda's Marysville Auto Plant. The Accord has achieved considerable success, especially in the United States, where it was the best-selling Japanese car for sixteen years (1982–97), topping its class in sales in 1991 and 2001, with around ten million vehicles sold. Numerous road tests, past and present, rate the Accord as one of the world's most reliable vehicles. The Accord has been on the Car and Driver 10Best list a record 30 times.In 1989, the Accord was the first vehicle sold under an import brand to become the best-selling automobile in the United States.",00208.jpg,00208.jpg

The first Inspire debuted in 1990 as the Accord Inspire, a sister nameplate to the Honda Vigor, but sold at different retail channels in Japan, known as Honda Verno for the Vigor/Saber, and the Inspire at Honda Clio stores. The Inspire was developed during what was known in Japan as the Japanese asset price bubble or ""bubble economy"".
In 1995, the Inspire was updated by the second generation model, on a platform it shared with the Honda Legend, and exported to the US as the Acura 3.2 TL, while the Vigor nameplate was replaced with the Honda Saber. The longitudinal 2.5 L straight-5 engine layout and platform remained and was sold as the Acura 2.5 TL.
In 1999, these cars were replaced by the third generation TL that was based on the US-spec Accord platform, and largely designed and engineered in the US by Honda R&D Americas, Inc. in Raymond, Ohio. Manufactured in the US, these were imported into Japan as the new Inspire and Saber.
In June 2003, the fourth generation Inspire was introduced in Japan derived from the North American Honda Accord V6. This Inspire marks the first time Honda introduced their Variable Cylinder Management technology. In October 2005, the fourth generation Inspire received a mild restyle, with new headlights, new taillights, revised interior and new colors. The Inspire targeted the Nissan Teana, the Toyota Mark X and numerous other entry level luxury cars from Japan.
In October 2007, the fifth generation of the Inspire was previewed at the Tokyo Auto Show. It is essentially a rebadged 2008 North American-market Accord with minor exterior and interior modifications.

The Odyssey had originally been conceived and engineered in Japan, in the wake of country's economic crisis of the 1990s – which in turn imposed severe constraints on the vehicle's size and overall concept, dictating the minivan's manufacture in an existing facility with minimal modification.  The result was a smaller minivan, in the compact MPV class, that was well received in the Japanese domestic market and less well received in North America. The first generation Odyssey was marketed in Europe as the Honda Shuttle.
Subsequent generations diverged to reflect market variations, and Honda built a plant in Lincoln, Alabama, incorporating the ability to manufacture larger models. Since model year 1999, Honda has marketed a larger (large MPV-class) Odyssey in North America and a smaller Odyssey in Japan and other markets.

Code-named X12, the Runna is smaller than the IKCO Samand (X7). The Runna will be offered with at least three four-cylinder engines, including a 108-horsepower 1.6-liter gasoline unit, a 95-horsepower 1.4-liter and a 1.7-liter powerplant that runs on CNG, both of which are reported to meet Euro IV and V emission standards and the ""Pedestrian Impact"" safety requirement. Features are said to include airbags, anti lock brakes, power steering and power windows.The first cars were expected to reach Iranian customers in mid-2011, with exports to Turkey and other neighboring countries to begin shortly after that. IKCO plans to build 150,000 Runnas a year at full production.A completely new appearance in the front and rear including engine hood, trunk lid, bumpers, lights, and fenders.
This vehicle has a tri-chamber type structure (just like the Peugeot 206). It is made from drawn steel sheet which ranges in thickness from 0.7 mm to 2.5 mm, depending on its function. High elastic strength steel sheets are used for components that are subjected to particularly high levels of stress, such as the front structural member supports or the sub frame. This enables both greater strength and a weight reduction of around 50% to be achieved over conventional sheets which would have to be more than twice as thick to withstand the same stresses.
One of the most important points at Iran Khodro Industrial Group whilst the specification for a new vehicle was being drawn up is safety.
It includes active and passive safety. The first one utilizes mechanical components and vehicle dynamics to push the accident threshold as far back as possible. The second complements the first and seeks to reduce the consequences of the accident by using as many options as possible. The Runna can claim to be a vehicle which can measure up to the safety features that one has a right to expect from a modern product.",00243.jpg,00243.jpg

The second generation ES 300 debuted in 1991, followed by the third generation ES 300 in 1996, and the fourth generation ES 300/330 in 2001. The first- through fourth generation sedans shared body styling elements with Japan-market Toyota sedans, and a domestic market equivalent, the Toyota Windom (Japanese: トヨタ・ウィンダム, Toyota Windamu), was sold until the launch of the fifth generation ES in 2006. The word ""Windom"" is a combination of ""win"" and the suffix ""dom"" expresses a state of perpetual victory. The fifth generation ES, featuring Lexus' own L-finesse body styling, debuted in early 2006 as a 2007 model. The sixth generation ES debuted in the first half of 2012 as a 2013 model, and features increased cabin dimensions due to a longer wheelbase which is shared with the full-size XX40 series Avalon.
Lexus has positioned the ES in the comfort luxury segment, with an emphasis on interior amenities, quietness, and ride quality, in contrast with more firm-riding sport sedans. Buyers seeking more performance-focused models are targeted by the Lexus IS and rival makes, with such models offering a sportier drive with differently tuned suspensions. In Europe, Japan and other markets where it was not available until the seventh generation model, the GS sport sedans occupy the mid-size category in the Lexus lineup. In the United States, the ES has been the best-selling Lexus sedan for over fifteen years.",00284.jpg,00284.jpg

The name GX stands for Grand Crossover. Lexus introduced the first generation, known as the GX 470 in 2002, and subsequently became the third SUV to enter the Lexus lineup. A five-speed automatic was always standard, as was a full-time four-wheel-drive system with low-range gearing. The 4.7-liter V8 engine in the GX 470 was the same as used on the larger LX 470. The firm next introduced the second generation model in 2009, badged GX 460 to reflect the switch to a 4.6-liter V8 engine. Lexus later released a lower displacement GX 400 in 2012 for the Chinese market, with a 4.0-liter V6 engine.
Although Toyota Motor Corporation's (TMC) iconic Land Cruiser (LC) wearing the Toyota badge is available globally in both a full and mid-size versions, depending on where the other full-size LC is marketed it wears either the Toyota LC Prado or the LEXUS GX badge. There are a few important market-driven, market-exclusive options available for the Prado and the GX, such as the Prado having a diesel engine option, right-hand steering, rear door mounted spare tire, to name a few but essentially the GX series is the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado model rebadged with the LEXUS name plates and fitted with additional luxury trim. Both the GX and Prado share a common platform, mechanicals, and a great majority of bodywork, and therefore share common basic dimensions. Likewise, the interiors were much the same with the GX receiving further premium touches. Both versions employ body-on-frame construction (BOF), an electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission, and permanent four-wheel drive with a center locking Torsen differential.In the Lexus lineup, the GX is positioned between the RX crossover and the premium full-size, off-road capable LX SUV (the Lexus badged Land Cruiser). All GX production has occurred at the Tahara plant in Japan, alongside the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado and the export-minded Toyota 4Runner. Both generations of the GX have been heavily based on the Prado and 4Runner, with updated frontal styling to better integrate with the Lexus lineup. Elsewhere, the changes are less prominent and mainly restricted to minor trimmings, such as wheels and taillamp lenses inserts. The first generation interior largely mirrors that of the Toyota-badged version. The second generation interior has been further differentiated with fewer shared components.",00285.jpg,00285.jpg

It is the second model in the F marque line of performance vehicles from Lexus, following the IS F. Three concept versions were unveiled, each debuting at the North American International Auto Show with the LF-A designation as part of the LF Series concept line. After beginning development in the early 2000s (with a codename of TXS), the first LF-A concept premiered in 2005, followed in 2007 by a second concept with a more completely furnished interior and exterior. The third version of the LF-A, featuring a roadster bodystyle premiered in 2008. The production model, trademarked LFA, was unveiled at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009. According to Lexus, the ""A"" in production LFA name stands for the ""Apex"" of the LF line of cars.Akio Toyoda, CEO of parent company Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) saw the LFA as an opportunity to create a global icon for the Lexus brand, embodying Toyoda's idea that the ultimate Lexus should connect with its owner.The production version of the Lexus LFA features a 412 kW (560 PS; 553 hp) V10 engine developed in collaboration with Yamaha exclusive to the car and a body made from carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). CFRP materials account for 65 percent of the LFA's body composition by mass. The LFA went into production in late 2010. A circuit-tuned variant debuted in 2012, and was one of the most expensive Japanese road cars ever built. Production ended in December 2012 with 500 cars produced, the final car being a Nürburgring Package model.In February 2016, Lexus' European boss Alain Uyttenhoven confirmed that there would be no new LFA replacement in the near future, stating: ""The LFA is an icon now and possibly always will be - we don't need to replace it to keep that status. It is a car we can reference for another 25 years if we choose. Its status is assured."" He went on to state: ""It is possible that we will one day create another supercar, but in my view a super-high-end machine is not what we need right now.""",00286.jpg,00286.jpg

The 2 is marketed sometimes as the Demio and under previous nameplates including Mazda 121, Mazda Metro and Ford Festiva Mini Wagon.
The third generation Demio earned the 2008 World Car of the Year title, while the fourth generation was awarded the 2014–2015 ""Japanese Car of the Year"".In Canada, Mexico and the United States, the Demio was sold by Toyota with slight styling changes as an iteration of the Toyota Yaris sedan. In the United States, it was initially marketed under Toyota's youth-oriented Scion brand as the Scion iA. For the 2017 model year, it was re-branded as the Toyota Yaris iA due to the discontinuation of the Scion marque. For the 2019 model year, the iA moniker was dropped. Presently, the ""Mazda2"" is available in Canada and Mexico, but not the United States except Puerto Rico. For the 2020 model year, the Demio-based Toyota Yaris hatchback is also available in the United States and Canada. Exports of the Demio-based Yaris sedan and hatchback for the United States ended in June 2020.Originating with the introduction of the Mazda 121 in 1987, this B-segment small car was based on the Mazda D-platform. Ford also used a version of the first-generation DA 121 known as the Ford Festiva. Mazda later released the Autozam Revue in 1990 with the next generation of the D-platform DB. It was redesigned for January 1993, still based on the same DB platform. Kia also built versions of the DA and DB, both for itself and for Ford's sale as the Ford Aspire in the United States which Kia sold as the Pride and Avella. The name ""Demio""  is derived from Latin meus to show possession, which in many Romance languages has become ""mio.""

It was launched by Mazda in 2004 and is only available in Japan.  The Verisa can be considered either a 'tall hatchback' or a 'low mini MPV'. The relationship between the Mazda Verisa and the more popular Mazda Demio is similar to that of the Ford Fusion (Europe) and the Ford Fiesta. Its height of 1,530 mm (60.2 in) is similar to other Japanese boxy subcompact cars and lower than European mini MPVs like the Fiat Idea and Opel Meriva.  The Verisa was previewed at the 2004 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as the Mazda MX Micro-Sport, although it was never sold there.
According to Mazda the name Verisa was created by combining the Italian word 'verità' (truth) with the English word 'satisfaction', and the intended result of the term Verisa is to signify 'true fulfillment'.  The car is built with the watchwords ""simple, quality and compact"" and is targeted towards couples in their 30s with individual style and values.  There is a Japanese website that shows the Verisa factory and shop options.The Verisa comes in front wheel drive (2WD) and electronic four wheel drive (e4WD) configurations.  There is one engine option that delivers the following power and efficiency figures:

Power = 83 kW (113 HP) (111 imperial hp) at 6,000 rpm
Torque = 140 N⋅m (14.3 kgf⋅m) at 4,000 rpm
Fuel consumption (2WD) = 5.5 l/100 km combined
CO2 (2WD) = 126.2 g/km
Fuel consumption (e4WD)  = 5.8 l/100 km combined
CO2 (e4WD) = 135 g/kmIn financial year 2004 Mazda produced 19,473 and sold 18,526 units. In financial year 2005 Mazda produced 14,336 and sold 14,416 units.

The car's final design was unveiled in September 2009 and was launched in mid-2011.
The MP4-12C used a carbon fibre composite chassis, and is powered by a longitudinally-mounted McLaren M838T 3.8 L (3,799 cc) twin-turbocharged V8 engine, generating approximately 600 PS (592 hp; 441 kW) at 7,500 rpm and around 600 N⋅m (443 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 5,600 rpm. The car made use of Formula 1-sourced technologies such as ""brake steer"", where the inside rear wheel is braking during fast cornering to reduce understeer. Power is transmitted to the wheels through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission manufactured by SSG. The entire drivetrain is the first to be entirely designed and produced in house by McLaren.
A convertible version of the car called the MP4-12C Spider, renamed the 12C Spider in 2012, was also available.

The car's name is derived from Spanish for ""summit"". The hood ornament uses an image of an acanthus leaf. The acanthus leaf was commonly used by classical Greeks to make a wreath for use as a crown.
In Japan, the Cima has traditionally been Nissan's rival to the Toyota Crown Royal Saloon G and later Majesta. The Cima in the first two generations was a more luxurious and larger version of the Cedric and Gloria, with the Cima sharing the V8 engine from the earlier flagship Nissan President, Nissan's alternative to the Toyota Century. The Nissan Cima was introduced in 1988 and was based on an elongated Cedric/Gloria chassis. With its phenomenal sales—about 64,000 units sold the first year and 120,000 in four years—the car became a symbol of the ""bubble economy"".
The Cedric Cima was sold at Nissan Motor Stores, while the Gloria Cima was sold at Nissan Prince Store. Later generations of the Cima shared the same platform as the President, with the Cima being a shorter version, thereby allowing Nissan to continue offering the Cima at Nissan Prince Store locations. The later iterations of the Cima were exported to the United States as the Infiniti Q45. The Q45 was discontinued after 2006, however the Cima and the President continued in production until August 2010, leaving the Nissan Fuga to become the lone flagship. April 2012, the Cima name was resurrected, and resumed ""flagship"" status in Japan as a longer wheelbase version of the Fuga.
The Cima nameplate was reported to be discontinued for the second time in 2020, due to declining sales.",00352.jpg,00352.jpg

The vans debuted at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. However, it is still sold in Japan.  Each version of the Quest rode a platform derived from that of the Nissan Maxima.
Both vehicles were initially powered by the 3.0 L Nissan VG30E V6 engine until 1998, when the Quest received the 3.3 L version of the same engine and a few minor updates, including a driver side sliding door, and grille and rear redesigns. The Quest was completely redesigned for 2004, while the Villager was discontinued and replaced with the Freestar-based Mercury Monterey. The third generation model was built on the FF-L platform, which it shares with the Altima, Maxima, Teana, and Murano. It also shares the 3.5 L VQ engine with those cars. The fourth generation model is built on the same platform as the 2011 Nissan Elgrand.",00366.jpg,00366.jpg

For the first generation of Tiida manufactured between 2004 and 2012, the series is designated C11 and was sold as a five-door hatchback and four-door sedan. This model straddled the subcompact and compact car segments. It retailed in North America as Nissan Versa, in parts of South America as Dodge Trazo, and in Southeast Asia for the sedan only under the title Nissan Latio. The C11 bridged the subcompact and compact car classes, acting as an intermediate model between the smaller Micra/March and larger Bluebird Sylphy and Sentra models within the global Nissan portfolio. Therefore, depending on the market, the C11 replaced different models and engrossed different segments. For example, in Japan the Tiida replaced the Nissan Sunny (B15) in Nissan's lineup as the smallest sedan. In most markets it slotted between the March and Bluebird Sylphy; for North America it became a new entry-level model below the Sentra; and elsewhere Tiida tended to occupy the role performed previously by the Nissan Almera/Pulsar/Sentra/Sunny (N16), sold in Japan as the Bluebird Sylphy (G10). The G10/N16's successor, the Bluebird Sylphy G11 was not widely sold outside Japan. The C11 started to be phased out in China first, during 2011 when partially replaced by the larger, compact class C12 Tiida/Pulsar hatchback. In 2012, the C11 began to be withdrawn from more markets as its main production bases ceased manufacture. The C11 was also replaced by the subcompact Nissan Note or Versa Note (E12) hatchback, and on the sedan fronts, by the subcompact Almera/Latio/Sunny/Versa (N17) and the compact Nissan Pulsar/Sylphy/Sentra (B17).
Nissan introduced a second generation of Tiida, the five-door hatchback C12 series in 2011 to the Chinese market. Starting in 2013, sales began in Thailand, then Australia and New Zealand as the Nissan Pulsar. The C12 represents a departure from the C11, increasing its dimensions to comfortably occupy the compact class. Nissan Tiida also called ""Patrida car"". The development was anchored with the Nissan Pulsar/Sylphy/Sentra (B17) which is effectively the sedan version of the C12.",00368.jpg,00368.jpg

The Clio is one of only two cars, the other being the Volkswagen Golf, to have been voted European Car of the Year twice, in 1991 and 2006.
The Clio is sold as the Renault Lutecia (Japanese: ルノー・ルーテシア, Runō Rūteshia) in Japan because Honda retains the rights to the name Clio after establishing the Honda Clio sales channel in 1984. Lutecia is derived from the name of Lutetia, an ancient Roman city that was the predecessor of Paris. The Renault Lutecia was formerly available through Yanase Co., Ltd., but in 1999 Renault purchased a stake in Japanese automaker Nissan. Following Renault's takeover, distribution rights for the Lutecia were handed over to Nissan locations in 2000.",00428.jpg,00428.jpg

It competes in Japan with the Honda Stream and the Nissan Lafesta.

The Isis uses a unique approach to the sliding doors in that the front passenger door and the rear passenger sliding door interlock when closed, instead of having a doorjamb that the doors attach to. Toyota calls this on the Japanese Wikipedia article ""Panoramic Door"". This door system is used only on the passenger side. The doors on the driver's side attach with a conventional doorjamb. The front passenger seat can be folded flat upon itself and then tilted forward to further provide passenger access. The doors also interlock with the top and bottom door openings so that both doors can be opened independently of each other. This door feature was first used by Toyota on the Toyota Raum. This door approach is also used on the U.S.-spec 2000–2006 Toyota Tundra Extra Cab as well as the Ford B-Max. This type of door was first used on the Nissan Prairie in 1981. When the terrorist group ISIS emerged in 2014, Toyota was criticised for inadvertently supplying the militant group ISIS with trucks, and was urged to change the name of the MPV.
For model year 2007 on Japanese models only, G-BOOK, a subscription telematics service is offered as an option.

Following – and initially deriving from – Volkswagen's first model, the Type 1 (Beetle), it was given the factory designation Type 2.As one of the forerunners of the modern cargo and passenger vans, the Type 2 gave rise to forward control competitors in the United States in the 1960s, including the Ford Econoline, the Dodge A100, and the Chevrolet Corvair 95 Corvan, the latter adapting the rear-engine configuration of the Corvair car in the same manner in which the VW Type 2 adapted the Type 1 layout.
European competition included the 1947–1981 Citroën H Van, the 1959–1980 Renault Estafette (both FF layout), and the 1953–1965 FR layout Ford Transit.
Japanese manufacturers also introduced similar vehicles, such as the Nissan Caravan, Toyota LiteAce and Subaru Sambar.
Like the Beetle, the van has received numerous nicknames worldwide, including the ""microbus"", ""minibus"", and, because of its popularity during the counterculture movement of the 1960s, ""Hippie van/bus"" has become its most popular.
