== The fable ==

In about 1490 the Italian writer Laurentius Abstemius expanded the proverb into a short fable in Latin titled De rustico amnem transituro in his Hecatomythium and this was subsequently included in European collections of Aesop's fables. In 1692 Roger L'Estrange included an outline of the Abstemius version in his edition of the fables under the title of A Country-man and a River, along with the interpretation that men of few words are dangerous:

A Country-man that was to pass a River, sounded it up and down to try where it was most fordable: and upon Trial he made this Observation on't: Where the Water ran Smooth, he found it Deepest; and on the contrary, Shallowest where it made most Noise. There's More Danger in a Reserv'd and Silent, than in a Noisy, Babbling Enemy.Slightly earlier than L'Estrange's translation, there was an amplified version of the story in La Fontaine's Fables under the title ""The torrent and the river"" (Le torrent et la rivière, VIII.23). It tells of a man trying to escape a robber who easily fords a turbulent stream but drowns in a smooth-flowing river, ending on the caution that 'Silent folk are dangerous'. The French proverb that is the nearest equivalent to the English 'still waters run deep' also emphasizes this danger: 'no water is worse than quiet water' (Il n’est pire eau que l’eau qui dort). When the caricaturist J. J. Grandville illustrated La Fontaine's fable, he further underlined this meaning by transposing it into a seduction scene. In the background a capering donkey and a shrew are advancing along the road, watched by a woman whose hands are clasped by a sleek cat. Unnoticed at her feet, a snake is slithering through the grass.

Some of these stories are included among Aesop's Fables, while others are of later origin, and from them have been derived idioms in English, French and Russian. 


== 1. The flea and the camel ==
Credited as among Aesop's Fables, and recorded in Latin by Phaedrus, the fable is numbered 137 in the Perry Index. There are also versions by the so-called Syntipas (47) via the Syriac, Ademar of Chabannes (60) in Mediaeval Latin, and in Medieval English by William Caxton (4.16). The story concerns a flea that travels on a camel and hops off at its journey's end, explaining that it does not wish to tire the camel any further. The camel replies that it was unaware it had a passenger. Phaedrus comments that ""He who, while he is of no standing, boasts to be of a lofty one, falls under contempt when he comes to be known.""


== 2. The gnat and the bull ==

Babrius recorded a variant story in which a gnat settles on a bull's horn but offers to fly off again if he finds it too much of a burden. The bull replies that he is indifferent either way and the moral is much the same as in the contemporary Phaedrus. The fable did not become generally known in Britain until a Latin verse translation appeared in Victorian text books and then versions in English fable collections.


== 3. The gnat's challenge ==
Ademar of Chabannes, who had a history of forgery, came up with a story of his own which he passed off as ancient. This appears as fable 564 in the Perry Index. There a gnat challenges a bull to a trial of strength but then claims that, by accepting, the bull has acknowledged it as his equal. Ademar's comment is that the bull ""should have dismissed this opponent as beneath contempt and the impertinent creature would not have had anything to boast about."" 


== 4. The fly on the chariot wheel ==
The fable was composed in Latin by Laurentius Abstemius and appeared in his Hecatomythium (1490) under the title Musca et Quadrigae. It was added to the Perry Index as Fable 724. Here a fly perches on a chariot during a race and comments on how much dust it is raising. Gabriele Faerno included it in his own Centum Fabulae (1563), giving the impression that it was of Aesopic origin, although verbally it is close to the text of Abstemius.Francis Bacon also took the fable to be Aesopic, observing that ""It was prettily devised of Æsop: The fly sat upon the axle-tree of the chariot-wheel, and said, What a dust do I raise!"" at the start of his essay “On Vainglory”. Eventually ‘the fly on the coach wheel’ became an English idiom with the meaning of ""one who fancies himself of mighty importance but who is in reality of none at all"".


== 5. The fly and the mule ==

This fable has the longest history of internal change. It was recorded by Phaedrus and is numbered 498 in the Perry Index. There, a fly seated on the cart threatens to sting the mule if it does not pull faster. The mule replies that he only fears the driver and his whip. Empty threats from bystanders mean nothing. This too entered the European canon, first through Heinrich Steinhöwel's collection of Aesop's fables (1464) and thereafter from books derived from it, including Caxton's collection. In Roger L'Estrange large collection, however, his ""The Fly on the Wheel"" seems to blend the two fables together: ""What a Dust do I raise! says the Fly upon the Coach-Wheel? and what a rate do I drive at, says the same Fly again upon the Horse's Buttock?""
La Fontaine's Fables expands the scenario with his treatment of ""La coche et la mouche"" (VII.9), where the emphasis shifts wholly to the insect. Six horses strain to pull a stage-coach up a sandy hill and all the passengers are obliged to get out. A fly now buzzes about, urging on the horses and supervising the progress of the coach, then complains that all the work has been left to it alone. The fabulist comments,
This version of the fable has twice been set to music: as the fifth piece in Benjamin Godard's Six Fables de La Fontaine (op. 17 1872/9); and as the second piece in Maurice Thiriet's Trois fables de La Fontaine (1959) for 4-part children's a cappella chorus. In French the idiomatic phrase Faire (or jouer) la mouche du coche continues to be applied to self-important do-nothings. Similarly, in Russian, the phrase ""Мы пахали!"" (""we've been plowing!"") is used to mock people exaggerating their contributions, after Ivan Dmitriev's variant featuring a fly that rides on a bull's horn as it ploughs.Hitherto, the fables had been pithily told, but La Fontaine's leisurely and circumstantial narration over the length of 32 lines went on to infect those who followed him in other languages with similar prolixity. William Godwin adapted the gist to a short story of ""The Fly in the Mail Coach"" in his Fables Ancient and Modern (1805), although otherwise seeming to draw more from L'Estrange than La Fontaine. The same is true of the prose version of ""The Fly and the Wagon"" that appeared in The Flowers of Fable (New York, 1833). Claimed there to be translated from the Dutch, that too mixes Abstemius with La Fontaine and culminates in a horse killing the fly with a switch of its tail.

== A fable of ingratitude ==
There are two related Greek versions of the fable. Illustrating the ingratitude of those who requite good deeds with cruelty, it concerns a walnut tree (καρυα) standing by the roadside whose nuts the passersby used to knock off by throwing sticks and stones. It then complained, 'People gladly enjoy my fruits, but they have a terrible way of showing their gratitude.' Its complaint is related to a debate on gratitude that occurs in a parallel Indian story from the Panchatantra. There a mango tree is asked whether it is lawful to return evil for good and replies that its experience of man is violent treatment despite providing him with fruit and shade. On the other hand, the 18th century German rationalist, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, questioned whether there are real grounds for gratitude in his fable of ""The Oak Tree and the Swine"". The pig feeding at the foot of an oak is reproached for its motives of pure greed by the tree and replies that it would only feel grateful if it could be sure that the oak had scattered the acorns there out of love for it.

The Greek fable was later the subject of an epigram by Antipater of Thessalonica:

They planted me, a walnut-tree, by the road-side
to amuse passing boys, as a mark for their well-aimed stones.
All my twigs and flourishing shoots are broken,
hit as I am by showers of pebbles.
It is no advantage for trees to be fruitful; I, indeed,
bore fruit only for my own undoing.This in turn gave rise to Latin versions, in one of which the tree is represented as being pelted with rods. There was also a much longer poem, at one time ascribed to Ovid but now thought to be an imitation, in which the nut tree complains at length of the violent way in which it is despoiled. In this more leisurely work of 182 lines, as well as Aesop's fable of the nut tree being the subject, there is a glance at another concerning The Travellers and the Plane Tree. While the fruit tree is treated with no respect, ‘barren plane trees have more honour for the shade they provide’ (at postquam platanis sterilem praebentibus umbram uberior quavis arbore venit honor).
In Renaissance times the fable was taken up by the compilers of emblem books, starting with the originator of this genre, Andrea Alciato. Eventually numbered 193 in the many editions of his Emblemata, it bore the device In fertilitatem sibi ipsi damnosam (fruitful to its own ruin), deriving from the last line of the original epigram by Antipater. Many of the illustrations accompanying this feature boys stoning the tree and gathering its fruit from the ground. In others, however, youths are shown with substantial sticks in their hands, as in the illustration here, and so suggest the folk belief that beating it made the tree more fruitful.


== The proverb of a woman, an ass and a walnut tree ==
A few decades before Alciato first published his emblem, Aesop's fable had served as basis for an independent version by Laurentius Abstemius in his Hecatomythium, published in the 1490s. Numbered 65, De nuce, asino et muliere describes how a woman asked the abused tree 'why it was so foolish as to give more and better nuts when struck by more and stronger blows? The tree replied: Have you forgotten about the proverb that goes: Nut tree, donkey and woman are bound by a similar law; these three things do nothing right if you stop beating them.' The moral that Abstemius draws from it is that people talk too much for their own good. 
The Italian proverb based on this lore was perpetuated in Britain for the next two centuries. George Pettie's translation of the Civil Conversations of Stefano Guazzo (1530–93), a book first published in Italy in 1574, records that he had once come across the proverb 'A woman, an ass and a walnut tree, Bring more fruit, the more beaten they be'. What is now the better known English version appears shortly after in the works of John Taylor, 

A woman, a spaniel and a walnut tree,
The more they're beaten the better still they be.Roger L'Estrange includes Abstemius' story in his Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists a century later. His shortened version runs: 'A Good Woman happen'd to pass by, as a Company of Young Fellows were Cudgelling a Wallnut-Tree, and ask'd them what they did that for? This is only by the Way of Discipline, says one of the Lads, for 'tis natural for Asses, Women, and Wallnut-Trees to Mend upon Beating.' L'Estrange's idiomatic comment, 'Spur a Jade a Question, and he'll Kick ye an Answer,' indicates his opinion of the sentiment. People's conversation will betray their true quality. Edmund Arwaker, on the other hand, gives the story another twist in his versified telling of the fables, Truth in Fiction (London, 1708). The talkative woman questions the tree in the course of a solitary walk and it replies in this way in order to silence her.Whatever may have been people's opinion of how well a woman, ass or dog respond to punishment, the belief that this was beneficial in the case of walnut trees persisted. One encyclopaedia of superstions reports that in country districts 'it was a common persuasion that whipping a walnut tree tended to increase the produce and improve the quality of the fruit’ and that this took place in early spring. Another explanation is that 'the old custom of beating a walnut-tree was carried out firstly to fetch down the fruit and secondly to break the long shoots and so encourage the production of short fruiting spurs.’

== Origin and variants ==
The phrase originates in a sermon by Jesus recorded in the Christian New Testament: Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves (Gospel of Matthew 7:15, King James Version) . The sermon then suggests that their true nature will be revealed by their actions (by their fruits shall ye know them, verse 16). In the centuries following, the phrase was used many times in the Latin writings of the Church Fathers and later on in European vernacular literature. A Latin proverb also emerged, Pelle sub agnina latitat mens saepe lupina (Under a sheep’s skin often hides a wolfish mind). Although the story of a wolf disguised as a sheep has been counted as one of Aesop's Fables in modern times, there is no record of a fable with this precise theme before the Middle Ages, although there are earlier fables of Aesop in Greek sources to which the Gospel parable might allude.
The first fable concerning a wolf that disguises itself in a sheep's skin is told by the 12th-century Greek rhetorician Nikephoros Basilakis in a work called Progymnasmata (rhetorical exercises). It is prefaced with the comment that 'You can get into trouble by wearing a disguise' and is followed by the illustrative story. 'A wolf once decided to change his nature by changing his appearance, and thus get plenty to eat. He put on a sheepskin and accompanied the flock to the pasture. The shepherd was fooled by the disguise. When night fell, the shepherd shut up the wolf in the fold with the rest of the sheep and as the fence was placed across the entrance, the sheepfold was securely closed off. But when the shepherd wanted a sheep for his supper, he took his knife and killed the wolf.'  The conclusion drawn is different from the Gospel story. In the former one is warned to beware of hypocritical evil-doers; Nikephoros warns that evil-doing carries its own penalty.

The next version does not appear until three centuries later in the Hecatomythium of the 15th-century Italian professor Laurentius Abstemius. In his telling, 'A wolf, dressed in a sheep's skin, blended himself in with the flock of sheep and every day killed one of the sheep. When the shepherd noticed this was happening, he hanged the wolf on a very tall tree. On other shepherds asking him why he had hanged a sheep, the shepherd answered: The skin is that of a sheep, but the activities were those of a wolf.' Abstemius' comment on the story follows the Biblical interpretation: 'people should be judged not by their outward demeanor but by their works, for many in sheep's clothing do the work of wolves'.Certain elements of this story are to be found in Aesop's fable of the shepherd who raised a wolf cub among his dogs. When it was grown, it secretly reverted to type. If a wolf stole a sheep and the dogs could not catch it, the guardian wolf continued the chase and shared the meal with the marauder. On other occasions it would kill a sheep and share the meat with the other dogs. Eventually the shepherd discovered what was happening and hanged the wolf. What may be a reference to this story occurs in an anonymous poem in the Greek Anthology in which a goat laments that it is made to suckle a wolf-cub,

The Greek fable is numbered 267 in the Perry Index. As in the case of The Walnut Tree, however, this would not have been the first time that Abstemius adapted one of Aesop's fables to fit a contemporary idiom, in this case that of the wolf in sheep's clothing. Though the commonest retelling of the story in English follows the version by Abstemius, it is often credited to Aesop.
Another variant fable by Aesop is number 234 in the Perry Index. This concerns a wolf that regularly comes to view the flock, but never attempts any harm. Eventually, the shepherd comes to trust it and on one occasion leaves the wolf on guard. He returns to find his flock decimated and blames himself for being taken in. In neither case is there the suggestion by Aesop that the wolf disguised itself as a sheep. 
Yet another variation on the disguise theme was included in the Cento favole morali (""100 moral fables"", 1570) of the Italian poet Giovanni Maria Verdizotti. In this the wolf dresses itself as a shepherd, but when it tries to imitate his call, it wakes the real shepherd and his dogs. Since the wolf is encumbered by its disguise, it cannot get away and is killed. This is the version followed in La Fontaine's Fables (III.3). The conclusion both poets draw is the same as that of Nikephoros. The story entered the English canon under the title ""The wolf turned shepherd"" in Roger L'Estrange's 1692 fable collection and in verse as ""The Wolf in Disguise"" in Robert Dodsley's Select fables of Esop and other fabulists (1765).


== Artistic interpretations ==
Earlier illustrations of the fable concentrated on the hanging of the wolf. More recently, the emphasis has been on the disguise. In France, the theme of the wolf disguised in shepherd's clothing is more common.A number of recent CDs are titled A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, although most are references to the idiom and the fable is not mentioned in the words of any of the songs. The same is true of many songs that have the phrase as their title. One exception is the lyric by Tackhead on their 1991 CD Strange Things, which uses the fable for a satirical attack on Capitalist entrepreneurs.


== In zoology ==

Zoologists have repeatedly compared predatory animals which make use of aggressive mimicry to a wolf in sheep's clothing, including jumping spiders, lacewings, ant-mimicking aphids, hemipteran bugs mimicking chrysomelid beetles, bird-dropping spiders, orchid mantises, cichlid fish, and the zone-tailed hawk which flies with vultures; these animals have evolved to deceive their prey by appearing as other prey, or like angler fish and snapping turtles lure the prey by appearing as the prey's prey.

Oath-taking and the penalties for perjuring oneself played an important part in the Ancient Greek concept of justice.


== Divine retribution ==
Hesiod's Theogony identifies Horkos as the son of Eris (""strife"") and brother of various tribulations: Ponos (""Hardship""), Lethe (""Forgetfulness""), Limos (""Starvation""), Algae (""Pains""), Hysminai (""Battles""), Makhai (""Wars""), Phonoi (""Murders""), Androktasiai (Manslaughters""), Neikea (""Quarrels""), Pseudea (""Lies""), Logoi (""Stories""), Amphillogiai (""Disputes""), Dysnomia (""Anarchy""), and Ate (""Ruin"").In his Works and Days, Hesiod states that the Erinyes (Furies) assisted at the birth of Horkos, ""whom Eris bore, to be a plague on those who take false oath"", and that the fifth of the month was especially dangerous as being the day on which he was born.  However, according to the moral given in an ethical parable related by Aesop, there is no fixed day on which the god's punishment falls on the wicked.
Aesop's fable concerns a man who had taken a deposit from a friend and, when asked to swear an oath regarding it, left the town hurriedly. A lame man whom he met told his fellow-traveller that he was Horkos on his way to track down wicked people.  The man asked Horkos how often he returned to the city they were leaving. ""I come back after forty years, or sometimes thirty,"" Horkos replied. Believing himself to be free from danger, the man returned the following morning and swore that he had never received the deposit.  Almost immediately, Horkos arrived to execute the perjurer by throwing him off a cliff. Protesting, the man asked why the god had said he was not coming back for years when in fact he did not grant even a day's reprieve. Horkos replied, ""You should also know that if somebody intends to provoke me, I am accustomed to come back again the very same day.""


== Concepts of justice ==

A similar story was told by Herodotus and may even have been the fable's origin. It concerned a man who asked the Delphic oracle’s advice about dishonouring such an oath and received the answer that he would profit for the moment but that it would bring about the destruction of him and his heirs - for Horkos has a son 'who is nameless and without hands or feet, swift in pursuit'. Nor can there be any repentance, for intent is no different from action.The severity of such justice underlines the importance of oath-taking in Ancient Greece, which was undertaken in the name of the gods. To perjure oneself meant waging war on the gods, who even themselves could suffer under the same sanctions. In taking an oath one called down a conditional curse on oneself, to take effect if one lied or broke one's promise. The lasting nature of this curse, and the corresponding benefit of honouring one's word, is also emphasised by Hesiod in discussing the matter: ""Whoever wilfully swears a false oath, telling a lie in his testimony, he himself is incurably hurt at the same time as he harms Justice, and in after times his family is left more obscure, whereas the family of the man who keeps his oath is better in after times.""In later times, the role of bringing justice for broken oaths was undertaken by the Furies, specified by Hesiod as the midwives at the birth of Horkos. Justice was also under the protection of the King of the gods, who in this aspect is referred to as Zeus Horkios (guardian of oaths); in circumstances where other divine entities were named, they too took responsibility for retribution.

== The Phaedrus version ==
 The early Latin version of Phaedrus begins with the reflection that ""Partnership with the mighty is never trustworthy"". It then relates how a cow, a goat and a sheep go hunting together with a lion. When it comes to dividing the spoil, the lion says, ""I take the first portion because of my title, since I am addressed as king; the second portion you will assign to me, since I’m your partner; then because I am the stronger, the third will follow me; and an accident will happen to anyone who touches the fourth."" This was listed as Fable 339 in the Perry Index and was later the version followed by William Caxton in his 1484 collection of the Fables.The number of differing variations circulating by the time of the Middle Ages is witnessed by the fact that Marie de France included two in her 12th century Ysopet. Both appear under the title ""The Lion Goes Hunting"" (De Leone Venante). On one occasion, she recounts, the lion is joined by officers of his court, a wild ox and a wolf, who divide the catch into three and invite their lord to apportion it. Then on another occasion, when the lion is accompanied by a goat and a sheep, the deer they take is divided into four. In both cases the lion begins by claiming portions as a legal right and retains the others with threats. In La Fontaine's Fables there is a fourfold division between a heifer, a goat and a lamb (Fables I.6). Each of these the lion retains because he is king, the strongest, the bravest, and will kill the first who touches the fourth part.A Latin reference to Aesop's fable is found at the start of the Common Era, where the phrase societas leonina (a leonine company) was used by one Roman lawyer to describe the kind of unequal business partnership described by Aesop. The early 19th century writer Jefferys Taylor also retold the fable in terms of a commercial enterprise in his poem ""The Beasts in Partnership"":

This firm once existed, I'd have you to know,
Messrs Lion, Wolf, Tiger, Fox, Leopard & Co;
These in business were join'd, and of course 'twas implied,
They their stocks should unite, and the profits divide.


== The Babrius version ==
In the extended Greek telling of Babrius it is a wild donkey and a lion who go hunting together, the first outstanding for strength, the second for speed. The lion divides their take into three, awarding himself the first because he is king of the beasts, the second because they are 'equal' partners, and suggesting that the ass runs away quickly rather than dare to touch the third. The moral Babrius draws is, ""Measure yourself! Do not engage in any business or partnership with a man more powerful!""Another version that first appeared in the Middle Ages is more cynical still. A fox joins the lion and donkey in hunting. When the donkey divides their catch into three equal portions, the angry lion kills the donkey and eats him. The fox then puts everything into one pile, leaving just a tiny bit for herself, and tells the lion to choose. When the lion asks her how she learned to share things this way, the fox replies, ""From the donkey’s misfortune."" This variation is given a separate number (149) in the Perry Index and is the one followed by such Neo-Latin writers as Gabriele Faerno and Hieronymus Osius and in English by Geoffrey Whitney.This alternative fable was given a different reading by the 13th century Persian poet, Rumi in his Masnavi. He began by orienting the reader to interpret the fable in a spiritual sense:

Melt away your existence, as copper in the elixir, in the being of Him who fosters existence.
You have fastened both your hands tight on 'I' and 'we': all this ruin is caused by dualism.In Rumi's telling, the lion had a wolf and a fox as hunting companions. The lion ordered the wolf to divide the catch and when it did so into three parts, tore off the wolf’s head, just as the lion tore the donkey to pieces in Aesop’s fable. Rumi's speciality, however, is always to offer an explanation of his actors' motives. In this case the lion explains that it is an act of grace for him to do so since the wolf did not recognise superiority when he saw it.
When the fox was tested in the same way, he did not even retain a morsel for himself, explaining (as in the Greek version) that he had learned wisdom from the wolf's fate and thanking the lion for giving him the privilege of going second. This allows Rumi to conclude that we are lucky to be living now, with the examples of past generations to guide us. Rumi’s fox then worships at the feet of the lion, addressing him with the words ""O king of the world"" and is duly rewarded for this devotion with everything that he had resigned to the divine king.
Much the same interpretation was given to the tale by Rumi's English contemporary, Odo of Cheriton, in the Latin work known as Parabolae. For him too the lion is a symbol of God and his actions are interpreted as an expression of divine justice. Odo explains that the lion punished the wolf, as God did Adam, for the sin of disobedience. The moral of the story is to learn from this example to show reverence to God, just as the fox learned from the wolf’s punishment. This reading of the fable therefore gained currency in Western Europe too, both via the preachers who used Odo's book as a source of stories for their sermons and through translations of it into French, Spanish and Welsh.


== Other related Eastern fables ==
There is a close family resemblance between fables where the lion takes all because he can and fables where an arbiter takes advantage of his powerful position, and indeed both are type 51 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system.  The 10th-century Arabic Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity tells one such arbitration fable, said there to be of Indian origin. Here a group of foxes are sharing a dead camel. They cannot decide how to divide it among themselves and persuade a passing wolf to make a just division. At first the wolf begins to do this, but on further consideration he decides to keep the rest for himself, as he is, after all, more powerful. (In this case, however, the foxes appeal to the lion who decides in their favour and kills the wolf and returns the camel to them.)
 
This fable shades into an Indian variant of the story, first told as the Dabbhapuppha Jataka, which features different animals but has at its centre the same situation of an animal making an unequal division. Here a jackal offers to arbitrate between two otters who are quarrelling over a fish they have co-operated in bringing to land. The jackal awards them the head and tail and runs off with the bulk of their catch. As well as being a condemnation of the greed that leads to strife, the tale takes a sceptical view of how the powerful frame the law to suit themselves, concluding with the satirical verse,

Just as, when strife arises among men,
They seek an arbiter: he's leader then;
Their wealth decays and the king's coffers gain.In that the tale deals with outside arbitration, however, it has certain points in common with another of Aesop's fables, The Lion, the Bear and the Fox, in which the first two beasts simultaneously attack a kid and then fight over their spoil. When they are both too exhausted to move, a fox steals their prey and leaves them to reflect, ""How much better it would have been to have shared in a friendly spirit.""

This was listed as Fable 339 in the Perry Index and was later the version followed by William Caxton in his 1484 collection of the Fables.</p><p>The number of differing variations circulating by the time of the Middle Ages is witnessed by the fact that Marie de France included two in her 12th century Ysopet. Both appear under the title ""The Lion Goes Hunting"" (<i>De Leone Venante</i>). On one occasion, she recounts, the lion is joined by officers of his court, a wild ox and a wolf, who divide the catch into three and invite their lord to apportion it. Then on another occasion, when the lion is accompanied by a goat and a sheep, the deer they take is divided into four. In both cases the lion begins by claiming portions as a legal right and retains the others with threats. In La Fontaine's Fables there is a fourfold division between a heifer, a goat and a lamb (<i>Fables</i> I.6). Each of these the lion retains because he is king, the strongest, the bravest, and will kill the first who touches the fourth part.</p><p>A Latin reference to Aesop's fable is found at the start of the Common Era, where the phrase <i>societas leonina</i> (a leonine company) was used by one Roman lawyer to describe the kind of unequal business partnership described by Aesop. The early 19th century writer Jefferys Taylor also retold the fable in terms of a commercial enterprise in his poem ""The Beasts in Partnership"":
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>This firm once existed, I'd have you to know,</dd>
<dd>Messrs Lion, Wolf, Tiger, Fox, Leopard &amp; Co;</dd>
<dd>These in business were join'd, and of course 'twas implied,</dd>
<dd>They their stocks should unite, and the profits divide.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><h2><span id=""The_Babrius_version"">The Babrius version</span></h2>
<p>In the extended Greek telling of Babrius it is a wild donkey and a lion who go hunting together, the first outstanding for strength, the second for speed. The lion divides their take into three, awarding himself the first because he is king of the beasts, the second because they are 'equal' partners, and suggesting that the ass runs away quickly rather than dare to touch the third. The moral Babrius draws is, ""Measure yourself! Do not engage in any business or partnership with a man more powerful!""</p><p>Another version that first appeared in the Middle Ages is more cynical still. A fox joins the lion and donkey in hunting. When the donkey divides their catch into three equal portions, the angry lion kills the donkey and eats him. The fox then puts everything into one pile, leaving just a tiny bit for herself, and tells the lion to choose. When the lion asks her how she learned to share things this way, the fox replies, ""From the donkey’s misfortune."" This variation is given a separate number (149) in the Perry Index and is the one followed by such Neo-Latin writers as Gabriele Faerno and Hieronymus Osius and in English by Geoffrey Whitney.</p><p>This alternative fable was given a different reading by the 13th century Persian poet, Rumi in his <i>Masnavi</i>. He began by orienting the reader to interpret the fable in a spiritual sense:
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><i>Melt away your existence, as copper in the elixir, in the being of Him who fosters existence.</i></dd>
<dd><i>You have fastened both your hands tight on 'I' and 'we': all this ruin is caused by dualism.</i></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>In Rumi's telling, the lion had a wolf and a fox as hunting companions. The lion ordered the wolf to divide the catch and when it did so into three parts, tore off the wolf’s head, just as the lion tore the donkey to pieces in Aesop’s fable. Rumi's speciality, however, is always to offer an explanation of his actors' motives. In this case the lion explains that it is an act of grace for him to do so since the wolf did not recognise superiority when he saw it.
</p><p>When the fox was tested in the same way, he did not even retain a morsel for himself, explaining (as in the Greek version) that he had learned wisdom from the wolf's fate and thanking the lion for giving him the privilege of going second. This allows Rumi to conclude that we are lucky to be living now, with the examples of past generations to guide us. Rumi’s fox then worships at the feet of the lion, addressing him with the words ""O king of the world"" and is duly rewarded for this devotion with everything that he had resigned to the divine king.
</p><p>Much the same interpretation was given to the tale by Rumi's English contemporary, Odo of Cheriton, in the Latin work known as <i>Parabolae</i>. For him too the lion is a symbol of God and his actions are interpreted as an expression of divine justice. Odo explains that the lion punished the wolf, as God did Adam, for the sin of disobedience. The moral of the story is to learn from this example to show reverence to God, just as the fox learned from the wolf’s punishment. This reading of the fable therefore gained currency in Western Europe too, both via the preachers who used Odo's book as a source of stories for their sermons and through translations of it into French, Spanish and Welsh.</p>
<h2><span id=""Other_related_Eastern_fables"">Other related Eastern fables</span></h2>
<p>There is a close family resemblance between fables where the lion takes all because he can and fables where an arbiter takes advantage of his powerful position, and indeed both are type 51 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system.  The 10th-century Arabic Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity tells one such arbitration fable, said there to be of Indian origin. Here a group of foxes are sharing a dead camel. They cannot decide how to divide it among themselves and persuade a passing wolf to make a just division. At first the wolf begins to do this, but on further consideration he decides to keep the rest for himself, as he is, after all, more powerful. (In this case, however, the foxes appeal to the lion who decides in their favour and kills the wolf and returns the camel to them.)</p>
 
<p>This fable shades into an Indian variant of the story, first told as the <i>Dabbhapuppha Jataka</i>, which features different animals but has at its centre the same situation of an animal making an unequal division. Here a jackal offers to arbitrate between two otters who are quarrelling over a fish they have co-operated in bringing to land. The jackal awards them the head and tail and runs off with the bulk of their catch. As well as being a condemnation of the greed that leads to strife, the tale takes a sceptical view of how the powerful frame the law to suit themselves, concluding with the satirical verse,
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><i>Just as, when strife arises among men,</i></dd>
<dd><i>They seek an arbiter: he's leader then;</i></dd>
<dd><i>Their wealth decays and the king's coffers gain</i>.</dd></dl></dd></dl><p>In that the tale deals with outside arbitration, however, it has certain points in common with another of Aesop's fables, The Lion, the Bear and the Fox, in which the first two beasts simultaneously attack a kid and then fight over their spoil. When they are both too exhausted to move, a fox steals their prey and leaves them to reflect, ""How much better it would have been to have shared in a friendly spirit.""

During the Renaissance, several literary works used him as a mouthpiece for their criticism of tyranny, while others later made him a critic of contemporary society. Onstage he finally became the figure of harmless fun.


== In classical literature ==
As a sharp-tongued spirit of unfair criticism, Momus was eventually expelled from the company of the gods on Mount Olympus. His name is related to μομφή, meaning 'blame', 'reproach', or 'disgrace'. Hesiod said that Momus was a son of Night (Nyx), ""though she lay with none"", and the twin of the misery goddess Oizys. In the 8th century BCE epic Cypria, Momus was credited with stirring up the Trojan War in order to reduce the human population. Sophocles wrote a later satyr play called Momos, now almost entirely lost, which may have derived from this.

Two of Aesop's fables feature the god. The most widely reported of these in Classical times is numbered 100 in the Perry Index. There Momus is asked to judge the handiwork of three gods (who vary depending on the version): a man, a house and a bull. He found all at fault: the man because his heart was not on view to judge his thoughts; the house because it had no wheels so as to avoid troublesome neighbours; and the bull because it did not have eyes in its horns to guide it when charging. Because of it, Plutarch and Aristotle criticized Aesop's story-telling as deficient in understanding, while Lucian insisted that anyone with sense was able to sound out a man's thoughts.As another result, Momus became a by-word for fault-finding, and the saying that if not even he could criticize something then that was the sign of its perfection. Thus a poem in the Greek Anthology remarks of statues by Praxiteles that ""Momus himself will cry out, 'Father Zeus, this was perfect skill'.""  Looking the lovely Aphrodite over, according to a second fable of Aesop's, number 455 in the Perry Index, it was light-heartedly noted that he could not find anything about her to fault except that her sandals squeaked.


== Political satire ==
A social comedy from the 2nd century CE served as inspiration for later criticisms of society. This was found in Lucian's ""The Gods in Council"", in which Momus takes a leading role in a discussion on how to purge Olympus of foreign gods and barbarian demi-gods who are lowering its heavenly tone. At the start of the Renaissance, Leon Battista Alberti wrote the political work Momus or The Prince (1446), which continued the god's story after his exile to earth.  Since his continued criticism of the gods was destabilizing the divine establishment, Jupiter bound him to a rock and had him castrated. Later, however, missing his candor, he sought out a manuscript that Momus had left behind in which was described how a land could be ruled with strictly regulated justice.At the start of the 16th century, Erasmus also presented Momus as a champion of legitimate criticism of authorities. Allowing that the god was ""not quite as popular as others, because few people freely admit criticism, yet I dare say of the whole crowd of gods celebrated by the poets, none was more useful."" Giordano Bruno's philosophical treatise The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast (1584) also looks back to Lucian's example. Momus there plays an integral part in the series of dialogues conducted by the Olympian deities and Bruno's narrators as Jupiter seeks to purge the universe of evil.


== Social satire ==
17th century English writers introduced the figure of Momus in a gentler spirit of fun, as in Thomas Carew's masque Coelum Britannicum (1634), which was acted before King Charles I and his court. There too Momus and Mercury draw up a plan to reform the 'Star Chamber' of Heaven. Two centuries on, it was to influence Henry David Thoreau as he was preparing to write his Walden.John Dryden's short ""Secular Masque"" (1700) mocks contemporary society through the medium of the Classical divinities, with Momus playing a leading part in deflating with sarcastic wit the sports represented by Diana (hunting), Mars (war), and Venus (love), for ""'Tis better to laugh than to cry"". It is with similar wryness that Carl Sandburg's statue of ""Momus"" (1914) surveys the never-changing human scene, ""On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history"", as they continue to overpopulate the world and then bleed it.


== Comedy ==
Elsewhere in Europe, Momus was becoming softened into a figure of light-hearted and sentimental comedy, the equivalent of Harlequin in the French and Italian Commedia dell'arte. A typical production has him competing for the amorous favours of a nymph in Henry Desmarets' opéra-ballet Les amours de Momus (1695).By this period, then, Momus was the patron of humorous satire, partnering the figures of comedy and tragedy. As such he appeared flanked by these female figures on the frontispiece to The Beauties of the English Stage (1737), while in Leonard Defraine's Figures of Fabled Gods (1820), he partners Comus, god of Carnival, and Themis, patroness of assemblies. Because of the Harlequin connection, too, and as the character able to make home-truths palatable through the use of humour, Momus had now taken the place of the Fool on a French Minchiate card pack. He also lent his name to George Saville Carey's satirical poem, Momus, or a critical examination into the merits of the performers and comic pieces at the Theatre-Royal in the Hay-Market (1767). The god himself plays no part there, only ""Momus' sons"", the comic actors.

== The fable ==

In about 1490 the Italian writer Laurentius Abstemius expanded the proverb into a short fable in Latin titled De rustico amnem transituro in his Hecatomythium and this was subsequently included in European collections of Aesop's fables. In 1692 Roger L'Estrange included an outline of the Abstemius version in his edition of the fables under the title of A Country-man and a River, along with the interpretation that men of few words are dangerous:

A Country-man that was to pass a River, sounded it up and down to try where it was most fordable: and upon Trial he made this Observation on't: Where the Water ran Smooth, he found it Deepest; and on the contrary, Shallowest where it made most Noise. There's More Danger in a Reserv'd and Silent, than in a Noisy, Babbling Enemy.Slightly earlier than L'Estrange's translation, there was an amplified version of the story in La Fontaine's Fables under the title ""The torrent and the river"" (Le torrent et la rivière, VIII.23). It tells of a man trying to escape a robber who easily fords a turbulent stream but drowns in a smooth-flowing river, ending on the caution that 'Silent folk are dangerous'. The French proverb that is the nearest equivalent to the English 'still waters run deep' also emphasizes this danger: 'no water is worse than quiet water' (Il n’est pire eau que l’eau qui dort). When the caricaturist J. J. Grandville illustrated La Fontaine's fable, he further underlined this meaning by transposing it into a seduction scene. In the background a capering donkey and a shrew are advancing along the road, watched by a woman whose hands are clasped by a sleek cat. Unnoticed at her feet, a snake is slithering through the grass.

The framework story in which Syntipas plays a leading part accompanies the immensely popular cluster of tales, reminiscent of the 1001 Nights, known generally in Europe as the History of the Seven Wise Masters (Historia Septem Sapientium) or Dolopathos. It is conjectured to have been of Persian origin and was eventually transmitted into many Oriental and Western languages. A Syriac version was translated into Greek by the Byzantine author Michael Andreopoulos at the end of the 11th century under the title of The Book of the Philosopher Syntipas. In his introduction, Andreopoulos describes it as a story which “derides evildoers and, towards its end, praises righteous deeds”, thus excusing a work otherwise characterised by “exoticism and eroticism”.In the Greek version, Syntipas is counsellor to King Cyrus and tutor to his son who, having taken a vow of silence for seven days, is accused by his stepmother of trying to seduce her. Over successive days there follows a competition of stories and counter-stories told by the king’s advisory philosophers and the stepmother whose advances he has rejected, thus putting off the prince’s execution until he is at liberty to tell the truth. This dénouement is followed by a few other tales illustrative of the situation.
Although a few of the 27 stories that appear there concern animals, the main protagonists of the majority are humans. This proportion was reversed in The Fables of Syntipas, a Syriac fable collection also translated by Andreopoulos which accompanied the Syntipas romance in some manuscripts. A Latin version of these was published in 1781 by Christian Frederick Matthaei, drawing the attention of scholars interested in the transmission of Aesop’s Fables. Eventually it was demonstrated that most had been translated into Syriac from an old Greek source as recently as the 9th century or later. Nearly a quarter of the 62 appearing there are not Aesopic, but otherwise it includes such well known examples as The Ant and the Grasshopper, The North Wind and the Sun and The Farmer and the Viper.

== A jackass in office ==

The Greek fable tells of an ass that is carrying a religious image and takes the homage of the crowd as being paid to him personally. When pride makes it refuse to go further, the driver beats it and declares that the world has not yet become so backward that men bow down to asses. The Latin title of the fable, Asinus portans mysteria (or its Greek equivalent, ονος αγων μυστήρια), was used proverbially of such human conceit and was recorded as such in the Adagia of Erasmus.The fable was revived in Renaissance times by Andrea Alciato in his Emblemata under the heading Non tibi sed religioni (not for your sake but religion's), and is placed in the context of the Egyptian cult of Isis. No less than three English versions of Alciato's accompanying Latin poem were written in the next few decades. The most significant is that of Geoffrey Whitney in his Choice of Emblemes, which is more a paraphrase dwelling foremost on the meaning of the fable. It draws the human parallel with religious 'pastors', but also with ambassadors in the secular sphere, both of whom act as intermediaries of a higher power.None of these authors ascribed the fable to Aesop, but Christoph Murer mentioned ""Aesop's Ass"" in his book of emblems, XL emblemata miscella nova (1620), where it was likened to those who pursue ambition. At this time also the neo-Latin poet Pantaleon Candidus alluded to it in describing ""those who aspire to great honours"". A contemporary English reference in The Conversations at Little Gidding (about 1630) also mentions ‘Aesops Asse interpreting the Prostrate Worship of the People that was offered to the Golden Image on his back as intended to his Beastliness’. This, however, was in the context of making a distinction between a man and his religious office. George Herbert (who may have taken part in these conversations) again alluded to this matter in his poem “The Church Porch”  (lines 265-8)  

When baseness is exalted, do not bate
The place its honour for the person’s sake.
The shrine is that which thou doest venerate,
And not the beast that bears it on his back.The story had another retelling in a Neo-Latin poem by Gabriele Faerno which, in its single-lined moral, draws the parallel with a magistrate who is only honoured for his office. The story was eventually given a Catholic context in La Fontaine's Fables, where it was titled ""The ass carrying relics"". However, the ending limits the lesson to secular office, as does Faerno: 'As with a stupid magistrate, it's to the robe that you prostrate' (D’un magistrat ignorant/C’est la Robe qu’on salue). Since then, illustrators of his Fables have often combined the fable and its lesson in the same picture, or even confined themselves to its worldly lesson alone.
Roger L'Estrange had similarly taken the fable, at much the same time as La Fontaine, as ‘a reproof to those men who take the honour and respect that is done to the character they sustain, to be paid to the person’. But after his time, although there were subsequent inclusions in English fable collections, it appeared in none of the best known until Victorian times. The lesson was emphasised then by its being titled ""The Jackass in Office"", in reference to the proverbial expression for a puffed up petty official, a jack in office.

== Fables ==
 
Of the two Greek versions of this story, the one catalogued as 188 in the Perry Index concerns an Ass that puts on a lion's skin and amuses himself by terrifying all the foolish animals. At last coming upon a Fox, he tried to frighten him also, but the Fox no sooner heard the sound of his voice than he exclaimed, ""I might possibly have been frightened myself, if I had not heard your bray."" The moral of the story is often quoted as Clothes may disguise a fool, but his words will give him away. It is this version which appears as Fable 56 in the collection by Babrius.The second version is listed as 358 in the Perry Index. In this the ass puts on the skin in order to be able to graze undisturbed in the fields but is given away by its ears and is chastised. As well as Greek versions, there is a later 5th century Latin version by Avianus which was taken up by William Caxton. The moral here cautions against presumption. Literary allusions were frequent from Classical times and into the Renaissance, when there were references to it in William Shakespeare's King John. La Fontaine's Fable 5.21 (1668) also follows this version. The moral La Fontaine draws is not to trust to appearances and that clothes do not make the man, while in the musical interpretation given it on David P. Shortland's Australian recording, Aesop Go HipHop (2012), the sung chorus after the hip hop narration emphasises the message, ""Be yourself, don’t hide behind a disguise"".


== Folk motifs and proverbial use ==
In India the same situation appears in Buddhist scriptures as the Sihacamma Jataka. Here the ass's master puts the lion's skin over his beast and turns it loose to feed in the grain fields during his travels. The village watchman is usually too terrified to do anything but finally one of them raises the villagers; when they chase the ass, it begins to bray and betrays its true identity. The ass is then beaten to death. A neighbouring tale, the Sihakottukha Jataka, plays on the motif of being given away by one's voice. In this a lion has sired a son on a she-jackal that looks like his father but has a jackal's howl. He is therefore advised to stay silent in future. A common European variant on this sentiment appears in the Sephardic proverb in Ladino, Asno callado, por sabio contado, a silent ass is considered wise. Another English equivalent is 'A fool is not known until he opens his mouth'.
The story and its variants is alluded to idiomatically in various other languages. In Latin it was Leonis exuviae super asinum. In Mandarin Chinese it is ""羊質虎皮""(pronunciation:yang(2) zhi(4) hu(3) pi(2)), ‘a goat in a tiger’s skin’. In the Chinese story a goat assumes this disguise but continues to eat grass as usual.  When it spies a wolf, instinct takes over and the goat takes to its heels.


== Later allusions ==

In American political culture, the ass in the lion's skin was one of several fables by Aesop that was put to use by cartoonist Thomas Nast when it was rumoured in 1874 that the Republican President Ulysses S. Grant would attempt to run for an unprecedented third term in two years' time. Around that time, there was also a false report that the animals had escaped from Central Park Zoo and were roaming the city. Nast combined the two items in a cartoon for the 7 November Harpers Weekly; titled ""Third Term Panic"", it depicts a donkey in a lion's skin (labelled Caesarism) scattering animals that stand for various interests.The fable was also put to literary use in the 20th century by C.S. Lewis. In The Last Battle, the final volume of The Chronicles of Narnia, a donkey named Puzzle is tricked into wearing a lion's skin, and then manipulated so as to deceive the simple-minded into believing that Aslan the lion has returned to Narnia. Kathryn Lindskoog identifies the Avianus version as the source of this episode.

Nast combined the two items in a cartoon for the 7 November <i>Harpers Weekly</i>; titled ""Third Term Panic"", it depicts a donkey in a lion's skin (labelled Caesarism) scattering animals that stand for various interests.</p><p>The fable was also put to literary use in the 20th century by C.S. Lewis. In The Last Battle, the final volume of The Chronicles of Narnia, a donkey named Puzzle is tricked into wearing a lion's skin, and then manipulated so as to deceive the simple-minded into believing that Aslan the lion has returned to Narnia. Kathryn Lindskoog identifies the Avianus version as the source of this episode.</p>

It has existed in numerous different versions between that time and the Middle Ages, going by various titles and generally involving members of the corvid family. The lesson to be learned from it has also varied, depending on the context in which it was told. Several idioms derive from the fable.


== The main variations ==

While the details of the fable have always been varied, two main versions have been transmitted to European cultures in modern times. The first of these is mostly found in Greek sources and numbered 101 in the Perry Index. It concerns a daw or crow that dresses itself in the feathers of other birds before competing against them, only to have them recognised and stripped away by their owners; in some versions all its own feathers are also torn away. The lesson to be learned is that borrowed finery brings humiliation.
The second version stems from the Latin collection of Phaedrus and is numbered 472 in the Perry Index. In this a jackdaw (or jay in Caxton's telling) that has found some peacock feathers and stuck them among its own, looks down on its kind and joins the peacocks. When they realise the intruder is not one of themselves, they attack it, stripping away the borrowed finery and leaving its so dishevelled that it is afterwards rejected by its fellows. The moral of the story is not to reach above one's station.
Some mediaeval versions have different details. In Odo of Cheriton's telling the crow is ashamed of its ugliness and is advised by the eagle to borrow feathers from the other birds, but when it starts to insult them the eagle suggests that the birds reclaim their feathers. Froissart's Chronicles have a certain Friar John advising church leaders that their possessions depend on temporal rulers and illustrating the lesson with a story of a bird that is born featherless until all the other birds decide to furnish it with some of their own. When it starts to act too proudly, they threaten to take their feathers back.Such stories addressed themselves to various kinds of pride and had given rise to the Latin idomatic phrase esopus graculus (Aesop's jackdaw) that Erasmus recorded in his Adagia. But the story has also been used to satirise literary plagiarists in Classical times. In one of his Epistles, the Roman poet Horace alludes to the Greek version of the fable when referring to the poet Celsus, who is advised not to borrow from others ‘lest, if it chance that the flock of birds should some time or other come to demand their feathers, he, like the daw stripped of his stolen colors, be exposed to ridicule.’ It was in this sense too that the young William Shakespeare was attacked by the elder playwright Robert Greene as ‘an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers’.When Jean de la Fontaine adapted the story in his Fables Choisies (IV.9), it was the Latin version of a bird disguised as a peacock that he chose, but he followed Horace in applying it to 'The human jay: the shameless plagiarist'. The very free version of John Matthews, his English translator, develops the suggestion much further:

If you closely examine the men of the quill
And search for goods stolen with sharp piercing eyes,
Taking these from the pages their volumes which fill,
Huge quartos would shrink to a very small size.However, when La Fontaine's fable was rewritten to fit a popular air in the 18th century Nouvelles Poésies Spirituelles et Morales sur les plus beaux airs, its focus was changed to dressing above one's station.It is the Latin version too that lies behind the popular idiom 'to adorn oneself (or strut) in borrowed plumes', used against empty pretensions. This is made more obvious by the reference to peacock feathers in the Italian equivalent, Vestirsi con le penne del pavone.Ivan Krylov wrote his own variation of the fable called ""The Crow"". The fable gave rise to two expressions in Russian (after two different phrases in it): ""Left the crows, but didn't join the peacocks"" (От ворон отстала, а к павам не пристала) and ""Neither peacock nor crow"" (Ни пава, ни ворона). While keeping close to the fable at the start, he ends by extending the application to the human example of a merchant's daughter marrying a noble and fitting neither with their family nor her own.


== Artistic use ==

In the 17th century, when paintings were popular home decorations but had to be justified by carrying a moral message, the Dutch artist Melchior d'Hondecoeter executed at least two of the Greek version of the fable in which many species of bird attack the daw. He was followed in 1719 by Pieter Casteels III, whose ""Fable of the Raven"" shows flocks of brightly coloured birds descending for the attack. English artists who have been influenced by their treatment of the subject include George Lance, whose “The vain jackdaw stripped of his borrowed plumes” was highly praised when he exhibited it at the British Institution in 1828, and Edward Bawden in the 20th century.Most illustrations of La Fontaine's fables, with their three or four peacocks bending to reclaim their plumes from the jay, show lack of originality. This is true even of Kano Tomo-nobou's Japanese woodcut version published from Tokyo in 1894. The most lively treatments of the theme are in political cartoons celebrating the defeat of Napoleon, in which feathered kings and emperors snatch away his finery. There was a slightly earlier Japanese woodprint by Kawanabe Kyosai in his Isoho Monogotari series (1870–80) which shows peacocks attacking a prostrate crow. In general the artist was dependent on John Tenniel's illustrations of the fables for his interpretations, but in this case the print is similar to the picture in the Croxall edition of 1814.There is an amusing nod in the fable's direction in Amelia Bauerle's etching ""Fine feathers make fine birds"" in The Yellow Book. Although the proverb is an alternative for 'Clothes make the man', the benignant wallpaper peacock bending over the little girl as she shows off her plumed hat suggests that it might pluck away the feathers if it had a mind to. The print suggests the relationship between the proverb, which focuses on reputation gained by presentation rather than merit, and the idiom 'dressed in borrowed plumes', which draws attention to another fraudulent aspect of reputation.

== The fable ==
The tale concerns a shepherd boy who repeatedly tricks nearby villagers into thinking a wolf is attacking his town's flock. When a wolf actually does appear and the boy again calls for help, the villagers believe that it is another false alarm and the sheep are eaten by the wolf. In later English-language poetic versions of the fable, the wolf also eats the boy. This happens in Fables for Five Year Olds (1830) by John Hookham Frere, in William Ellery Leonard's Aesop & Hyssop (1912), and in Louis Untermeyer's 1965 poem.The moral stated at the end of the Greek version is, ""this shows how liars are rewarded: even if they tell the truth, no one believes them"". It echoes a statement attributed to Aristotle by Diogenes Laërtius in his The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, in which the sage was asked what those who tell lies gain by it and he answered ""that when they speak truth they are not believed"". William Caxton similarly closes his version with the remark that ""men bileve not lyghtly hym whiche is knowen for a lyer"".


== Fable's history ==
The story dates from Classical times, but, since it was recorded only in Greek and not translated into Latin until the 15th century, it only began to gain currency after it appeared in Heinrich Steinhöwel's collection of the fables and so spread through the rest of Europe. For this reason, there was no agreed title for the story. Caxton titles it ""Of the child whiche kepte the sheep"" (1484), Hieronymus Osius ""The boy who lied"" (""De mendace puero"", 1574), Francis Barlow ""Of the herd boy and the farmers"" (""De pastoris puero et agricolis"", 1687), Roger L'Estrange ""A boy and false alarms"" (1692), and George Fyler Townsend ""The shepherd boy and the wolf"" (1867). It was under the final title that Edward Hughes set it as the first of ten Songs from Aesop's Fables for children's voices and piano, in a poetic version by Peter Westmore (1965).Teachers have used the fable as a cautionary tale about telling the truth, but an educational experiment in the first decade of the 21st century suggested that reading ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" increased children's likelihood of lying. On the other hand, reading a book on George Washington and the cherry tree decreased this likelihood dramatically. The suggestibility and favourable outcome of the behaviour described, therefore, seems the key to moral instruction of the young. However, when dealing with the moral behaviour of adults, Samuel Croxall asks, referencing political alarmism, ""when we are alarmed with imaginary dangers in respect of the public, till the cry grows quite stale and threadbare, how can it be expected we should know when to guard ourselves against real ones?""

== The story from the East ==

The version of the story found in the Indian Panchatantra concerns a lion who is persuaded that the cure for his sickness is the ears and heart of an ass. His servant the jackal persuades an ass to accompany him but the lion is too weak to kill the ass on the first attempt and the jackal has to trick it into returning. Afterwards the jackal persuades the hungry lion to leave him with the dead ass and takes the ears and heart for himself. His explanation for their absence is that so silly an animal cannot have had the equipment to hear or to think with.The story travelled westwards through a series of translations and adaptations and was eventually carried to Spain by invading Arabs. By this time the details of the story had altered considerably. In one Arab version an ass demands toll of the lion and is killed for this effrontery. The heart is eaten by a fox who says it could never have existed in so stupid an animal. There also exist Jewish versions of the story, in one of which the ass figures as toll-keeper and in the other demands a fare on board ship.


== The story from the West ==
The story of ""The Lion, the Fox and the Deer"" is an ancient one that first appeared in the poetry of Archilochus and was told at great length in the collection of Babrius. In this the fox twice persuades the deer to visit the lair of a lion too sick to hunt, on the first occasion escaping with an injured ear; the fox explains this as a rough caress and the deer returns to its death. It was only recorded in Greek, so that Mediaeval European variants may equally be of Eastern rather than Western origin. Thus in Marie de France's telling, the lion requires the deer's heart as a cure for its illness, as in the Panchatantra.The very different version in her contemporary, Berechiah ha-Nakdan's ""Fox Fables"", appears to owe something to a Latin poem by Avianus, numbered 583 in the Perry Index. In this a boar has its ears cut off as a punishment for roaming in the fields of an estate and later pays for it with his life. A thieving peasant explains the missing heart to his master in the usual way. But in Berechiah's telling the wild boar trespasses in the royal lion's garden and, after losing its ears and eyes in punishment, is finally killed and the heart is stolen by the fox. These final details demonstrate a synthesis with other versions of the fable, of which there appear to be many by this time. A still later Spanish version by Juan Ruiz, involves a musical ass who keeps the lion awake with his discordant music and in this case loses his heart and ears to the wolf.The process of transformation continues into modern times. In Stuart Croft's 12-minute film The Stag without a Heart (2009/10), the story is recounted at length in an endlessly circuitous version by having the fox replace the heart it has stolen in the deer as a means of persuading it to return to the lion's presence.

</p>","The situation of the Eagle Wounded by an Arrow vaned with its own feathers is referred to in several ancient Greek sources and is listed as fable 276 in the Perry Index. It is generally applied to the misery of realising that one has contributed to one's own injury but also as a warning against self-reliant pride.


== The fable and its interpretations ==
The earliest mention of the fable is a brief reference in The Myrmidons, a lost tragedy of Aeschylus written in the 5th century BCE. Here it is said to be of Libyan origin and is generally supposed to refer to the personal blame felt by Achilles for the death of his friend Patroclus.
So the eagle, pierced by the bow-sped shaft, looked
At the feathered device and said, “Thus, not by others,
But by means of our own plumage are we slain”.Widespread references to the fable afterwards suggest that it had gained proverbial force. A version titled  ""The Archer and the Eagle"" and ascribed to Aesop appeared among the collection of fables by Babrius.The fable did not appear in mediaeval collections of fables reliant on Latin sources but began to be noticed in Europe from the 16th century. In Guillaume La Perrière's Emblem book Le théatre des bons engins (The theatre of fine devices, 1544), there is an illustration of the wounded eagle accompanied by a verse commenting that its sorrow at being struck down is doubled by the knowledge that it has furnished the means for its own destruction. But when the situation appeared in La Fontaine's Fables, it was under the more generalised title of ""The bird wounded by an arrow"" (II.6) and a wider lesson is drawn from the incident. The dying bird blames humans for using its own parts against itself and claims that they have learnt this cruelty from the way they treat each other.

A contemporary French emblem book took a different view of how the bird had contributed to its own hurt. Daniel de la Feuille's Devises et emblêmes (1691) starts from the perception that the bird in the poem was on the look-out for a hare. If another hunter brings it down while so engaged, then it is a case of poetic justice, of having inflicted on itself the harm it was purposing to inflict on others. Illustrated under the Latin title Capiens capior (the preyer become prey), it shows a sparrow hawk perched on a hare with an arrow through its own neck. There is also a coded reference to the fable in a mountain landscape by Anne-Louis Girodet dating from 1793/5. There an eagle pierced by an arrow lies at the foot of the picture, while towards it a huge snake is crawling across the rocks. Its writhing is echoed by the strangling ivy that climbs the tree beneath which the bird has fallen. Violence and cruelty is not limited to the human sphere; in the artist's eyes they are characteristic of nature as a whole.The Greek origin of the fable was not lost sight of in France and Isaac de Benserade included L'aigle percé d'une flèche in his collection of Aesop's fables, recounting how it had allowed certain feathers to drop while grooming itself which were collected by the hunter who shot it.Pierre de Frasnay (1676–1753) also provided a four-line poetic version in his Mythologie ou recueil des fables grecques, ésopiques et sybaritiques (Orléans 1750). The moral he drew from the story was that one should not be too self-reliant, for that too is an avenue that leads to harm.Condemnation of pride was the interpretation given the fable when it travelled eastwards as well. In the 11th century Diwan (poetical works) of Nasir Khusraw, an eagle soars through the air, vaunting itself. When it is brought down by a hunter and recognises the feathers on the arrow, the realisation comes that it has been injured by its own means. Pieter de la Court was to give the story a similar interpretation in his Sinryke Fabulen (1685), making the point that those who thrust themselves into prominence become the mark for others to harm. The point is underlined by the Latin tag beneath the illustration of the injured bird, an adaptation of proverbial lines from the 4th century Latin poet Claudian: Vivitur exiguo melius, natura beatis / omnibus esse dedit, si quis cognoverit uti (it is better to live on little, [nature has provided for all to do so happily,] could one but know it).Yet another fable of similar meaning is numbered 303 in the Perry Index. In it an oak (or a pine in another version) complains of being split by wedges made from its own branches. Commentaries on these fables point out that suffering is increased by the knowledge that it is one's own fault.


== Poetical allusions ==
The proverbial image of the wounded eagle was to become a common conceit in English poetry of the 17th century and after. Just as Aeschylus described his image as coming from Libya, James Howell identifies the 2nd century writer Lucian as his source in a commendatory poem on the work of Giles Fletcher:

England, like Lucian’s eagle with an arrow
Of her own plumes, piercing her heart quite thorow.As he does so, he is also echoing the same conceit used in Fletcher's poem ""Christ's Victory in Heaven"".Two poets identified with the Cavalier cause also used the conceit. Katherine Philips placed it at the start of her poem ""On Controversies in Religion"" (1667), arguing that religion becomes the victim of misapplied texts

And meets that Eagles destiny, whose breast
Felt the same shaft which his own feathers drest.Edmund Waller, on the other hand, turned the image to Baroque hyperbole by making himself the victim of ""A Lady singing a Song of his Composing"".The image was still current at the start of the 19th century. Lord Byron used it in the course of lamenting the early death of Henry Kirke White while still a student. At more or less the same time, Thomas Moore applied it in his early political poem ""Corruption"" (1808).


== Artistic use ==

La Fontaine's version of the fable was illustrated by woodcuts in various editions over the centuries, usually by nothing more original than a picture of a bird lying on the ground with an arrow piercing its neck or breast. One or other of these served as model for the left-hand page of Kawanabe Kyosui's coloured woodcut in the collectors edition Choix de Fables de La Fontaine published from Tokyo in 1894 with illustrations by Japanese artists. What brings the composition to life is the depiction of the bowman crouching on the bushy shore on the right-hand page.Marc Chagall also included a distant bowman in his coloured print of 1927 but gives greater prominence to the death agonies of the wounded bird, which is echoed by the waving foliage in the background. André Masson's L'oiseau percé de flèches (1925) equally gives a sense of painful movement. In this Cubist work, the stricken bird inclines diagonally across a stylised rocky background and still aspires upwards.The painting by Rosa Bonheur of a wounded eagle in mid-air (c. 1870) is not generally referred to the original Greek fable and no arrow is shown there. Instead, it is the eagle's political symbolism on which critics comment, interpreting the work as referring both to the defeat of Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian war and to the injury to the Prussian state of its aggression. Nevertheless, the theme of harm brought by its own agency is available as an alternative reading.
Among musical settings of La Fontaine's fable are Heitor Villa-Lobos' for voice and piano (1913), and that of Marcelle de Manziarly as the second of her Trois Fables de La Fontaine (1935). In addition, it was Marianne Moore’s poetical versions that were used in Ned Rorem's Fables (1971) as the basis of his 'very short operas', of which ""The bird wounded by an arrow"" is placed third.

== Stampeding before doom ==
The oldest form of a fable involving a stampede started by a hare appears in the form of a cumulative tale known in the Buddhist scriptures as the Duddubha Jataka (332). On hearing the sound of a falling fruit, a hare sets all the other animals fleeing in the belief that the earth was collapsing. There the story is associated with the Indian idiom 'the sound the hare heard', meaning an impossibility. A much later Western equivalent is the folk tale of Henny Penny, where the associated idiom is 'the sky is falling'.
In the Aesopic fable of ""The Hares and the Frogs"" the stampede is more limited. There are several versions in both Greek and Latin. In some the hares are set in motion by the sound of wind in the leaves; in others they call a meeting in which they come to the conclusion that their lives are so perpetually under threat that they may as well fling themselves into the river. As they are dashing towards it, however, they disturb the frogs on the bank who all leap into the water. Seeing this, a more thoughtful hare calls off the decision to kill themselves; if there are some creatures who can be frightened by hares, then their own lot cannot be as bad as they imagined. 
In the story retold about 1190 in Marie de France's Ysopet, the hares have decided to move to another land but halt when they see frogs leaping into a pond to escape them and come to the conclusion that ""never will they find a kingdom, or come to a place on this earth, where everyone may live without fear, work or sorrow"". The Jewish version of Marie's near contemporary, Berechiah ha-Nakdan, makes the band of emigrants terrified even of the croaking of frogs at night before deciding to return home.Two Neo-Latin poems are dedicated to the fable by Hieronymus Osius in his collection of 1564. In the first of these, he draws a parallel with human suffering and remarks that no-one really wishes to die; in the shorter poem that follows, the conclusion is that learning to overcome our fears is part of growing up. Eduard de Dene's Dutch version of the tale makes an emblematic appearance under the title ""A stout heart is the remedy for fear"", where it is given a religious interpretation. The illustrator of that book was Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder, who eventually fled to England. His woodcut of the subject was to be reproduced there as a trencher, about the edge of which the gist of its moral is epitomised as needing to fear destruction of the soul rather than of the body. A century later, in 1668, the Classical story was told with stylish panache of a single hare in La Fontaine's Fables (II.14).
During mediaeval times, some commentaries on the fable underlined the necessity of remaining philosophically contented. This theme was also taken up when the fable was included in Robert Dodsley's collection and subsequently reprinted in Thomas Bewick's illustrated edition of The Fables of Aesop in 1818. There it ends with the verse reflection,

The miseries of half mankind unknown,
Fools vainly think no sorrows like their own;
But view the world and you will learn to bear
Misfortunes well, since all men have their share.The same conclusion, that one should commiserate with the sufferings of others, was also the conclusion of the Neo-Latin retelling by Pantaleon Candidus at the start of the 17th century.

== The fable ==
According to the earliest source, Phaedrus, the story concerns a group of frogs who called on the great god Zeus to send them a king. He threw down a log, which fell in their pond with a loud splash and terrified them. Eventually one of the frogs peeped above the water and, seeing that it was no longer moving, soon all hopped upon it and made fun of their king.
Then the frogs made a second request for a real king and were sent a water snake that started eating them. Once more the frogs appealed to Zeus, but this time he replied that they must face the consequences of their request.
In later variations of the story, the water snake is often replaced with a stork or heron.


== Commentary, analysis and depiction ==

The original context of the story, as related by Phaedrus, makes it clear that people feel the need of laws but are impatient of personal restraint. His closing advice is to be content for fear of worse. By the time of William Caxton, who published the first version in English, the lesson drawn is that 'he that hath liberty ought to kepe it wel, for nothyng is better than liberty'. In his version, it is a heron rather than a snake that is sent as king. A later commentator, the English Royalist Roger L'Estrange, sums up the situation thus: 'The mob are uneasy without a ruler. They are as restless with one; and oftner they shift, the worse they are: so that Government or no Government, a King of God’s making or of the Peoples, or none at all, the Multitude are never to be satisfied.'Yet another view was expressed by German theologian Martin Luther in his ""On Governmental Authority"" (1523). There he speaks of the fewness of good rulers, taking this lack as a punishment for human wickedness. He then alludes to this fable to illustrate how humanity deserves the rulers it gets: 'frogs must have their storks.' The author Christoff Mürer has a similar sentiment in his emblem book XL emblemata miscella nova (1620). Under the title Freheit there is a verse that warns that those who do not appreciate freedom are sent a tyrant by divine will.The story was one of the 39 Aesop's fables chosen by Louis XIV of France for the labyrinth of Versailles, a hedge maze of hydraulic statues created for him in 1669 in the Gardens of Versailles, at the suggestion of Charles Perrault. It is likely he was aware of its interpretation in favour of contentment with the status quo. Jean de la Fontaine's fable of Les grenouilles qui desirent un roi (III.4) follows the Phaedrus version fairly closely and repeats the conclusion there. In setting the scene, however, he pictures the frogs as 'tiring of their democratic state', taking in 1668 much the same sardonic stance as Roger L'Estrange would do in 1692. La Fontaine was writing shortly after the restoration of the monarchy in England following a period of republican government; L'Estrange made his comment three years after a revolution had overthrown the restored regime and installed another.
As soon as the French had their own experience of regime-change, illustrators began to express their feelings through this fable too. A cartoon dating from 1791 and titled Le roi soliveau, ou les grenouilles qui demandent un roi (King Log, or the frogs demand a king) wryly portrays those responsible for the Champ de Mars massacre. In the following century, the caricaturist Grandville turned to illustrating La Fontaine's fables after a censorship law made life difficult for him. There it is a recognisably imperial stork who struts through the water wearing a laurel crown, cheered on one side by sycophantic supporters and causing havoc on the other. Ernest Griset, the son of French political refugees from yet another change of regime, followed the same example. His horrific picture of a gruesome skeletal stork seated on a bank and swallowing his prey appeared in an 1869 edition of Aesop's fables. It is his comment on the Second French Empire that had driven his parents into exile.
The gloom of 19th-century illustrators was mitigated by a more light-hearted touch in the following century. In the 1912 edition of Aesop's Fables, Arthur Rackham chose to picture the carefree frogs at play on their King Log, a much rarer subject among illustrators. But the French artist Benjamin Rabier, having already illustrated a collection of La Fontaine's fables, subverted the whole subject in a later picture, Le Toboggan (‘The sleigh-run’, 1925). In this, the stork too has become a willing plaything of the frogs as they gleefully hop onto his back and use his bill as a water-slide.


== Literary allusions ==

The majority of literary allusions to the fable have contrasted the passivity of King Log with the energetic policy of King Stork, but it was pressed into the service of political commentary in the title ""King Stork and King Log: at the dawn of a new reign"", a study of Russia written in 1895 by the political assassin Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, using the pen-name S. Stepniak. The book contrasts the policy of the reactionary Tsar Alexander III with the likely policy under Nicholas II, who had only just succeeded to the throne.As well as a later passing reference in the title of Alyse Gregory's feminist novel King Log and Lady Lea (1929), the fable was also reinterpreted in one of Margaret Atwood's four short fictions in a 2005 issue of the magazine Daedalus. Entitled ""King Log in Exile"", it features the deposed king musing on his ineffective reign, gradually illustrating that his inertia hid not harmlessness but a corrupt selfishness.Two modern poetical references are dismissive. Thom Gunn alludes to the fable in the opening stanzas of his poem ""The Court Revolt"". The situation described is a conspiracy in which many courtiers connive out of sheer boredom: 'King stork was welcome to replace a log'. New Zealand poet James K. Baxter, on the other hand, expresses a preference in his epigram Election 1960:

W. H. Auden recreated the fable at some length in verse as part of the three ""Moralities"" he wrote for the German composer Hans Werner Henze to set for orchestra and children's chorus in 1967. The theme of all three is the wrong choices made by people who do not sufficiently appreciate their good fortune when they have it. The first poem of the set follows the creatures' fall, from a state of innocence when In the first age the frogs dwelt at peace, into dissatisfaction, foolishness and disaster. Two centuries earlier, the German poet Gotthold Ephraim Lessing had given the theme an even darker reinterpretation in his ""The Water Snake"" (Die Wasserschlange). Taking its beginning from the Phaedrus version, the poem relates how a frog asks the snake why it is devouring his kind. 'Because you have invited me to,' is the reply; but when the frog denies this, the snake declares that it will therefore eat the frog because he has not. Part of a set of variations on Aesopic themes, this appears as the last in Gary Bachlund's recent setting of five fables by Lessing (Fünf Fabelen, 2008).Earlier musical settings included one by Louis-Nicolas Clérambault of words based on La Fontaine's fable (1730s) and Louis Lacombe's setting of La Fontaine's own words (Op. 72) for four men's voices as part of his 15 fables de La Fontaine (1875). It also figures as the third of Maurice Thiriet's Trois fables de La Fontaine for four children singing a cappella.


== Films ==
In 1922, Polish animator Władysław Starewicz produced a stop-motion animated film based on the tale in Paris entitled Les Grenouilles qui demandent un roi (aka Frogland). The final episode of the BBC series I, Claudius (1976), following the frequent allusions in Robert Graves's source novel Claudius the God, was titled ""Old King Log"". In it the aging emperor refers to himself as such, to the confusion of his advisors.

</p><p>Then the frogs made a second request for a real king and were sent a water snake that started eating them. Once more the frogs appealed to Zeus, but this time he replied that they must face the consequences of their request.
</p><p>In later variations of the story, the water snake is often replaced with a stork or heron.

<p>The original context of the story, as related by Phaedrus, makes it clear that people feel the need of laws but are impatient of personal restraint. His closing advice is to be content for fear of worse. By the time of William Caxton, who published the first version in English, the lesson drawn is that '<span lang=""enm"" title=""Middle English language text"">he that hath liberty ought to kepe it wel, for nothyng is better than liberty</span>'. In his version, it is a heron rather than a snake that is sent as king. A later commentator, the English Royalist Roger L'Estrange, sums up the situation thus: '<span lang=""enm"" title=""Middle English language text"">The mob are uneasy without a ruler. They are as restless with one; and oftner they shift, the worse they are: so that Government or no Government, a King of God’s making or of the Peoples, or none at all, the Multitude are never to be satisfied.</span>'</p><p>Yet another view was expressed by German theologian Martin Luther in his ""On Governmental Authority"" (1523). There he speaks of the fewness of good rulers, taking this lack as a punishment for human wickedness. He then alludes to this fable to illustrate how humanity deserves the rulers it gets: 'frogs must have their storks.' The author Christoff Mürer has a similar sentiment in his emblem book <i>XL emblemata miscella nova</i> (1620). Under the title <i>Freheit</i> there is a verse that warns that those who do not appreciate freedom are sent a tyrant by divine will.</p><p>The story was one of the 39 Aesop's fables chosen by Louis XIV of France for the labyrinth of Versailles, a hedge maze of hydraulic statues created for him in 1669 in the Gardens of Versailles, at the suggestion of Charles Perrault. It is likely he was aware of its interpretation in favour of contentment with the <i>status quo</i>. Jean de la Fontaine's fable of <i lang=""fr"" title=""French language text"">Les grenouilles qui desirent un roi</i> (III.4) follows the Phaedrus version fairly closely and repeats the conclusion there. In setting the scene, however, he pictures the frogs as 'tiring of their democratic state', taking in 1668 much the same sardonic stance as Roger L'Estrange would do in 1692. La Fontaine was writing shortly after the restoration of the monarchy in England following a period of republican government; L'Estrange made his comment three years after a revolution had overthrown the restored regime and installed another.
</p><p>As soon as the French had their own experience of regime-change, illustrators began to express their feelings through this fable too. A cartoon dating from 1791 and titled <i>Le roi soliveau, ou les grenouilles qui demandent un roi</i> (King Log, or the frogs demand a king) wryly portrays those responsible for the Champ de Mars massacre. In the following century, the caricaturist Grandville turned to illustrating La Fontaine's fables after a censorship law made life difficult for him. There it is a recognisably imperial stork who struts through the water wearing a laurel crown, cheered on one side by sycophantic supporters and causing havoc on the other. Ernest Griset, the son of French political refugees from yet another change of regime, followed the same example. His horrific picture of a gruesome skeletal stork seated on a bank and swallowing his prey appeared in an 1869 edition of Aesop's fables. It is his comment on the Second French Empire that had driven his parents into exile.
</p><p>The gloom of 19th-century illustrators was mitigated by a more light-hearted touch in the following century. In the 1912 edition of Aesop's Fables, Arthur Rackham chose to picture the carefree frogs at play on their King Log, a much rarer subject among illustrators. But the French artist Benjamin Rabier, having already illustrated a collection of La Fontaine's fables, subverted the whole subject in a later picture, <i>Le Toboggan</i> (‘The sleigh-run’, 1925). In this, the stork too has become a willing plaything of the frogs as they gleefully hop onto his back and use his bill as a water-slide.</p>
<h2><span id=""Literary_allusions"">Literary allusions</span></h2>

<p>The majority of literary allusions to the fable have contrasted the passivity of King Log with the energetic policy of King Stork, but it was pressed into the service of political commentary in the title ""King Stork and King Log: at the dawn of a new reign"", a study of Russia written in 1895 by the political assassin Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, using the pen-name S. Stepniak. The book contrasts the policy of the reactionary Tsar Alexander III with the likely policy under Nicholas II, who had only just succeeded to the throne.</p><p>As well as a later passing reference in the title of Alyse Gregory's feminist novel <i>King Log and Lady Lea</i> (1929), the fable was also reinterpreted in one of Margaret Atwood's four short fictions in a 2005 issue of the magazine <i>Daedalus</i>. Entitled ""King Log in Exile"", it features the deposed king musing on his ineffective reign, gradually illustrating that his inertia hid not harmlessness but a corrupt selfishness.</p><p>Two modern poetical references are dismissive. Thom Gunn alludes to the fable in the opening stanzas of his poem ""The Court Revolt"". The situation described is a conspiracy in which many courtiers connive out of sheer boredom: 'King stork was welcome to replace a log'. New Zealand poet James K. Baxter, on the other hand, expresses a preference in his epigram <i>Election 1960</i>:
</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>W. H. Auden recreated the fable at some length in verse as part of the three ""Moralities"" he wrote for the German composer Hans Werner Henze to set for orchestra and children's chorus in 1967. The theme of all three is the wrong choices made by people who do not sufficiently appreciate their good fortune when they have it. The first poem of the set follows the creatures' fall, from a state of innocence when <i>In the first age the frogs dwelt at peace</i>, into dissatisfaction, foolishness and disaster. Two centuries earlier, the German poet Gotthold Ephraim Lessing had given the theme an even darker reinterpretation in his ""The Water Snake"" (<i>Die Wasserschlange</i>). Taking its beginning from the Phaedrus version, the poem relates how a frog asks the snake why it is devouring his kind. 'Because you have invited me to,' is the reply; but when the frog denies this, the snake declares that it will therefore eat the frog because he has not. Part of a set of variations on Aesopic themes, this appears as the last in Gary Bachlund's recent setting of five fables by Lessing (<i>Fünf Fabelen</i>, 2008).</p><p>Earlier musical settings included one by Louis-Nicolas Clérambault of words based on La Fontaine's fable (1730s) and Louis Lacombe's setting of La Fontaine's own words (Op. 72) for four men's voices as part of his <i>15 fables de La Fontaine</i> (1875). It also figures as the third of Maurice Thiriet's <i>Trois fables de La Fontaine</i> for four children singing a cappella.

It serves as a cautionary tale on the need for cultivating honesty, even at the price of self-interest. It is also classified as Aarne-Thompson 729: The Axe falls into the Stream.


== The story ==
The Greek version of the story tells of a woodcutter who accidentally dropped his axe into a river and, because this was his only means of livelihood, sat down and wept. Taking pity on him, the god Hermes (also known as Mercury) dived into the water and returned with a golden axe. ""Was this what you had lost?"", Hermes asked, but the woodcutter said it was not, and returned the same answer when a silver axe was brought to the surface. Only when his own tool is produced does he claim it. Impressed by his honesty, the god allows him to keep all three. Hearing of the man's good fortune, an envious neighbor threw his own axe into the river and wailed for its return. When Hermes appeared and offered him a golden axe, the man greedily claimed it but was denied both that and the return of his own axe.
Though the tale's moral is that 'Honesty is the best policy', as the English proverb has it, there existed a medieval Byzantine proverb apparently alluding to the fable, which stated that 'A river does not always bring axes'. But since this was glossed to mean that no person always acts consistently, it is obviously at a considerable remove from the story's application. The sequence of ideas that led to this understanding of the fable also exposes the gap in the envious neighbor's logic. He had observed the proximate cause for enrichment, namely dropping an axe in the river, and overlooked the ultimate cause - the need for scrupulous honesty. The right combination of circumstances had to be there for Hermes to act as he did. Without them, as the neighbor eventually learned, 'the river does not always bring (golden) axes'. 
A burlesque retelling of the fable occurs in François Rabelais's 16th-century novel Gargantua and Pantagruel. It takes up most of the author's prologue to the 4th Book and is considerably extended in his typically prolix and circuitous style. The woodcutter's cries disturb the chief of the gods as he deliberates the world's business and he sends Mercury down with instructions to test the man with the three axes and cut off his head if he chooses wrongly. Although he survives the test and returns a rich man, the entire countryside decides to follow his example and gets decapitated. So, Rabelais concludes, it is better to be moderate in our desires. Much the same story is told in La Fontaine's Fables (V.1) but in more concentrated form. However, rather than beheading the woodman's imitators, Mercury merely administers a heavy blow.


== The fable in the arts ==

Some paintings named from the fable have been broad landscapes with small figures added in the middle plane. Salvator Rosa's Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman in the National Gallery, London, dates from about 1650. An 18th-century watercolour by George Robertson (1748–88) seems to derive from this. Charles-André van Loo gives greater prominence to the figures in his Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron in the Hôtel de Soubise. In this the god hovers in mid-air and presents the axes to the surprised and kneeling woodman. 
Illustrations of the fable on English chinaware draw on the woodcut in Samuel Croxall's edition of Aesop. A Wedgwood plate of about 1775 displays a red picture in a square, garlanded frame. The rim has a wavy edge printed with detached sprays of flowers. Much the same picture as there, printed in green, is used on a contemporary Liverpool tile. In the left foreground, Mercury is presenting an axe to the seated woodman. In the distance, on the opposite bank, his dishonest neighbour has raised his axe before throwing it into the river. 
In 1987 the story was included on the 40 drachma value of the eight-stamp set of Aesop's fables issued by Greece and features the naked god seated on a rock in the river and offering the three axes to the bearded woodman on the bank.There has also been a musical interpretation on David P. Shortland's Australian recording, Aesop Go HipHop (2012), where Mercury is renamed a genie and the sung chorus after the hip hop narration emphasises the fable's proverbial message that ""Honesty is the best policy"".


== Other versions ==
The appearance of other tellings of the story, with local variations, from Nigeria, Thailand and Tibet, seems to call in question the purely Greek origin of the story. The Thai account claims to originate from a Buddhist Jataka tale but gives no source for a comparison to be made. Since the main lines of the story in all three are the same as in Aesopic versions, one might infer that, whatever their original form, they have since been influenced by the European model. 
A certain kinship has also been observed between the fable and the account of the miraculous recovery of an axe from a river in the Jewish Bible. There the prophet Elisha was travelling with some members of a religious community 'and when they came to the Jordan, they began cutting down trees; but it chanced that as one man was felling a trunk, the head of his axe flew off into the water. ""Oh master,"" he exclaimed, ""it was a borrowed one."" ""Where did it fall?"" asked the man of God. When he was shown the place, he cut off a piece of wood and threw it in and made the iron float'(NEB, Kings II, 6.4-6).

== 1. The flea and the camel ==
Credited as among Aesop's Fables, and recorded in Latin by Phaedrus, the fable is numbered 137 in the Perry Index. There are also versions by the so-called Syntipas (47) via the Syriac, Ademar of Chabannes (60) in Mediaeval Latin, and in Medieval English by William Caxton (4.16). The story concerns a flea that travels on a camel and hops off at its journey's end, explaining that it does not wish to tire the camel any further. The camel replies that it was unaware it had a passenger. Phaedrus comments that ""He who, while he is of no standing, boasts to be of a lofty one, falls under contempt when he comes to be known.""


== 2. The gnat and the bull ==

Babrius recorded a variant story in which a gnat settles on a bull's horn but offers to fly off again if he finds it too much of a burden. The bull replies that he is indifferent either way and the moral is much the same as in the contemporary Phaedrus. The fable did not become generally known in Britain until a Latin verse translation appeared in Victorian text books and then versions in English fable collections.


== 3. The gnat's challenge ==
Ademar of Chabannes, who had a history of forgery, came up with a story of his own which he passed off as ancient. This appears as fable 564 in the Perry Index. There a gnat challenges a bull to a trial of strength but then claims that, by accepting, the bull has acknowledged it as his equal. Ademar's comment is that the bull ""should have dismissed this opponent as beneath contempt and the impertinent creature would not have had anything to boast about."" 


== 4. The fly on the chariot wheel ==
The fable was composed in Latin by Laurentius Abstemius and appeared in his Hecatomythium (1490) under the title Musca et Quadrigae. It was added to the Perry Index as Fable 724. Here a fly perches on a chariot during a race and comments on how much dust it is raising. Gabriele Faerno included it in his own Centum Fabulae (1563), giving the impression that it was of Aesopic origin, although verbally it is close to the text of Abstemius.Francis Bacon also took the fable to be Aesopic, observing that ""It was prettily devised of Æsop: The fly sat upon the axle-tree of the chariot-wheel, and said, What a dust do I raise!"" at the start of his essay “On Vainglory”. Eventually ‘the fly on the coach wheel’ became an English idiom with the meaning of ""one who fancies himself of mighty importance but who is in reality of none at all"".


== 5. The fly and the mule ==

This fable has the longest history of internal change. It was recorded by Phaedrus and is numbered 498 in the Perry Index. There, a fly seated on the cart threatens to sting the mule if it does not pull faster. The mule replies that he only fears the driver and his whip. Empty threats from bystanders mean nothing. This too entered the European canon, first through Heinrich Steinhöwel's collection of Aesop's fables (1464) and thereafter from books derived from it, including Caxton's collection. In Roger L'Estrange large collection, however, his ""The Fly on the Wheel"" seems to blend the two fables together: ""What a Dust do I raise! says the Fly upon the Coach-Wheel? and what a rate do I drive at, says the same Fly again upon the Horse's Buttock?""
La Fontaine's Fables expands the scenario with his treatment of ""La coche et la mouche"" (VII.9), where the emphasis shifts wholly to the insect. Six horses strain to pull a stage-coach up a sandy hill and all the passengers are obliged to get out. A fly now buzzes about, urging on the horses and supervising the progress of the coach, then complains that all the work has been left to it alone. The fabulist comments,
This version of the fable has twice been set to music: as the fifth piece in Benjamin Godard's Six Fables de La Fontaine (op. 17 1872/9); and as the second piece in Maurice Thiriet's Trois fables de La Fontaine (1959) for 4-part children's a cappella chorus. In French the idiomatic phrase Faire (or jouer) la mouche du coche continues to be applied to self-important do-nothings. Similarly, in Russian, the phrase ""Мы пахали!"" (""we've been plowing!"") is used to mock people exaggerating their contributions, after Ivan Dmitriev's variant featuring a fly that rides on a bull's horn as it ploughs.Hitherto, the fables had been pithily told, but La Fontaine's leisurely and circumstantial narration over the length of 32 lines went on to infect those who followed him in other languages with similar prolixity. William Godwin adapted the gist to a short story of ""The Fly in the Mail Coach"" in his Fables Ancient and Modern (1805), although otherwise seeming to draw more from L'Estrange than La Fontaine. The same is true of the prose version of ""The Fly and the Wagon"" that appeared in The Flowers of Fable (New York, 1833). Claimed there to be translated from the Dutch, that too mixes Abstemius with La Fontaine and culminates in a horse killing the fly with a switch of its tail.

In Roger L'Estrange large collection, however, his ""The Fly on the Wheel"" seems to blend the two fables together: ""What a Dust do I raise! says the Fly upon the Coach-Wheel? and what a rate do I drive at, says the same Fly again upon the Horse's Buttock?""</p>
<p>La Fontaine's Fables expands the scenario with his treatment of ""<i>La coche et la mouche</i>"" (VII.9), where the emphasis shifts wholly to the insect. Six horses strain to pull a stage-coach up a sandy hill and all the passengers are obliged to get out. A fly now buzzes about, urging on the horses and supervising the progress of the coach, then complains that all the work has been left to it alone. The fabulist comments,</p>
<p>This version of the fable has twice been set to music: as the fifth piece in Benjamin Godard's <i>Six Fables de La Fontaine</i> (op. 17 1872/9); and as the second piece in Maurice Thiriet's <i>Trois fables de La Fontaine</i> (1959) for 4-part children's a cappella chorus. In French the idiomatic phrase <i>Faire (or jouer) la mouche du coche</i> continues to be applied to self-important do-nothings. Similarly, in Russian, the phrase ""Мы пахали!"" (""we've been plowing!"") is used to mock people exaggerating their contributions, after Ivan Dmitriev's variant featuring a fly that rides on a bull's horn as it ploughs.</p><p>Hitherto, the fables had been pithily told, but La Fontaine's leisurely and circumstantial narration over the length of 32 lines went on to infect those who followed him in other languages with similar prolixity. William Godwin adapted the gist to a short story of ""The Fly in the Mail Coach"" in his <i>Fables Ancient and Modern</i> (1805), although otherwise seeming to draw more from L'Estrange than La Fontaine. The same is true of the prose version of ""The Fly and the Wagon"" that appeared in <i>The Flowers of Fable</i> (New York, 1833). Claimed there to be translated from the Dutch, that too mixes Abstemius with La Fontaine and culminates in a horse killing the fly with a switch of its tail.

It is used in illustration of the insults given those who have fallen from power and has a similar moral to the fable of The dogs and the lion's skin. Parallel proverbs of similar meaning were later associated with it.


== The fable ==
In the fable as Phaedrus tells it, after the lion had grown old and feeble, a boar and a bull took their revenge for past attacks by injuring him. But when a donkey joins in and kicks him, the lion laments that suffering insult from such a base creature is like a second death. Different animals figure in later accounts. For Marie de France in the 12th century, the bull that gores the lion and the ass that kicks him are joined by a fox that bites at his ears. In her version too, it is not simply that they take advantage of his loss of kingly power but that some of his courtiers have now forgotten past favours. In La Fontaine’s 1668 version the attacks come from  a horse, a wolf and a bull, as well as the ass, but it ends with exactly the same sentiment as in Phaedrus.  La Fontaine’s choice of animals is influenced by a tag drawn from Horace, a frequent source for him. Used of the natural instinct of self defence, the Latin Dente lupus, cornu taurus petit (the wolf attacks with his teeth, the bull with his horns, Satires II.1.55) had become proverbial.The Neo-Latin poem “Leo Senex” by Hieronymus Osius shifted the emphasis to the pain that a formerly powerful human feels now that he cannot protect himself, leaving the cautionary story as no more than a metaphor. William Caxton urged the necessity of humility in his retelling, while tempering tyranny is counselled by other English authors, including Francis Barlow (1667), Roger L'Estrange (1692) and Samuel Croxall (1722).The English versions of La Fontaine’s fable which began to appear from early in the 18th century were also individual interpretations. That in Bernard de Mandeville’s Aesop Dress’d (1704) is largely an elegant paraphrase and ends with a clever pun. Charles Denis (Select Fables, 1754) translates the title as “The Old Lion”, adds an ape and a fox to the attackers and ends on a new moral, summed up in the line “be good as you are great”. The moral stanza added by John Matthews (London 1820) is given a topical twist by being applied to the conduct of politicians and pamphleteers during the madness of King George III. Of Ivan Krylov's two Russian versions of the fable published in 1825, ""The Aged Lion"" was faithful to La Fontaine's. The second, ""The Fox and the Ass"", was more of an adaptation: there the Ass boasts of his deed in conversation with a Fox afterwards and the moral drawn at the end is that the most lowly and sycophantic people will be the first to settle scores once the tables are turned.
More modern reinterpretations of La Fontaine’s fable have included Ladislas Starevich’s film using animated puppets (1932) and several musical settings: by Louis Lacombe as part of his 15 melodies (op. 72, 1875);  by Florent Schmitt in his Fables sans morales (Op.130, 1954); and by Isabelle Aboulker in Les Fables Enchantées (2004).


== Proverbs ==

The line from Horace inserted by La Fontaine into his Le lion devenu vieux was far from the only Latin proverb associated with the fable. The meaning of two more parallel the fable’s moral that those who lose power must suffer from those they had tyrannised previously. One concerns the false valour of tearing the beard of a dead lion (barbam vellere mortuo leoni) that reappears, among other places, as an insult in Shakespeare’s play King John (2.i):

You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard.The other proverb also concerned the hare, traditionally the most timorous of beasts, and spread to the rest of Europe from an epigram in the suspect version of the Greek Anthology edited by Maximus Planudes. In this the defeated Hector recalls that even a hare will leap on a dead lion in a line that was later imitated by Andrea Alciato in the poem accompanying his emblem on the futility of wrestling with the dead.The same proverb was later adapted into a fable by Pieter de la Court in his Sinryke Fabulen (Amsterdam, 1685). His version is prefaced by the Latin equivalent, mortuo leone et lepores insultant, and tells how a selection of animals take their revenge on the dead beast, including wolves, bears, foxes and apes. Finally a hare leaps on the corpse and tears at the beard. While this fable retains scarcely a detail from those of Phaedrus or La Fontaine, its dependence on them is unmistakable.
The popularity of La Fontaine’s fables gave rise to still more proverbs that alluded to them, most notably in this case, le coup de pied de l’âne. There were even dialect equivalents such as the Picard L’caup d’ pied du baudet, which is glossed in the dictionary that records it as a cowardly insult to someone from whom one has nothing to fear. But the fable’s title itself eventually came to be used proverbially, for example as the title of a novel by Ernest Feydeau (Paris 1872) and a historical play by Jean Schlumberger (Paris, 1924). Poetically it appeared as a refrain in a ballade by Alexandre Marie, a mourning of lost powers that has more or less the same theme as Starevich’s film. Similarly the fallen Baron Haussmann justified himself in the poem Confessions d’un lion devenu vieux (Paris 1888).

</p>","The Lion in Love is a cautionary tale of Greek origin which was counted among Aesop's Fables and is numbered 140 in the Perry Index. Its present title is a translation of the one given by Jean de la Fontaine after he retold it in his fables. Since then it has been treated frequently by artists. It has also acquired idiomatic force and as such has been used as the title of several literary works.


== The fable and its interpretation ==
A lion falls in love with a peasant's daughter and asks the father's permission to marry her. Unwilling to refuse outright, the man sets the condition that the animal should first have its claws clipped and its teeth filed. When the lion complies, the man clubs it to death, or in milder accounts simply drives it away, since it now can no longer defend itself.
Though the story was included in early collections of Aesop's fables, including those of Babrius and Aphthonius of Antioch, its earliest relation is as part of a war leader's speech in the 1st century BCE Bibliotheca historica of Diodorus Siculus, where it is described without ascription as an ""old story"". Significantly, the fable is interpreted there as a warning against ever letting down one's guard where an enemy is concerned and Aphthonius too comments that ""If you follow the advice of your enemies, you will run into danger"".
By the time the fable reappeared in Europe after the Renaissance it was being reinterpreted as a caution against being led astray by passion. The Neo-Latin poem Leo procus of Hieronymus Osius ends with the reflection ""By love the cleverest , sometimes, / are led astray, the strongest tamed"". A century later, Francis Barlow's illustration of what he titles Leo Amatorius is summed up in the couplet ""Love asailes with powerfull charmes, / and both our Prudence and our strength disarmes"". La Fontaine titled his poem Le lion amoureux and ended with the sentiment ""O love, O love, mastered by you, / prudence we well may bid adieu"" (IV.1).One of the factors influencing this interpretation was the development of the Renaissance emblem associated with the Latin sentiment Amor vincit omnia (Love conquers all). In a medal struck in 1444, Pisanello pictures a lion fawning on winged Cupid. This was reprised in the Emblemata amatoria (1607/8) of Daniël Heinsius as a Cupid astride a rampant lion, accompanied in one edition by a poem in French in which Love boasts that ""the lion is conquered by my taming arrow"". The interpretation is that even the fiercest nature can be tamed by love, but the reference to a lion inevitably brings to mind the well known instance of his fatal subjection to love in the fable. In illustrations during the following centuries, the lion fawns on his lady love in the same attitude as in Pisanello's medal, as for instance on the plate from the La Fontaine series of Keller & Guerin at the Luneville potteries.


== The fable in the arts ==
Illustrations of the fable were rare before the 19th century. In the 18th, it was the subject of an Aubusson tapestry to a design of Jean-Baptiste Oudry, and in England it was painted during the 1790s by James Northcote.

It was not until the 19th century that artists confronted the questionable morality of the human actors in the fable and treated the woman as more than a passive bystander. The change in attitude is evident in Camille Roqueplan's painting of 1836 which makes the lion's love-object the one who clips its claws (see left), a detail absent from the text. Its iconography is reminiscent of the story of Delilah's betrayal of Samson and especially those paintings in which Samson's head rests on her lap while she crops his hair and attackers lurk in the background. Another treatment of the theme is the 1851 statue by Guillaume Geefs in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, although in this case the lady is sitting on the lion's back as she works with her scissors.The subject also lends itself to satirical interpretation and was chosen for this purpose by the Japanese caricaturist Kawanabe Kyōsai for his Isoho Monogotari series (1870–80). More recently Diane Victor has used it in her lithograph ""The lion who loved the lady"" (2011) to comment on the relationship between China and Africa. In other depictions too, as in paintings by Gustave Moreau, Adolphe Weisz (1838 – after 1900) and Henri Courcelles-Dumont (1856–1918), the woman flaunts her naked body in a show of power over the beast. In 2011 this theme was notoriously adapted to a scent advert by Bulgari.There were other sculptural treatments of the fable, including the statue by Hippolyte Maindron in the Parc de Blossac, Poitiers, erected in 1883, although the original plaster model was shown at the 1869 Salon. Smaller replicas of Geefs' statue were made for sale after it appeared at The Great Exhibition and the Exposition Universelle (1855), and in 1885 Mintons issued a similar Parian ware figure of its own. Spode had already used an illustration of the fable on its Aesop series of table china, dating from 1830, and from 1900 the Zanesville Tile Company reproduced the Walter Crane illustration from Baby's Own Aesop (1887) on its product.In the world of music, the fable was twice made the subject of a ballet under its French title. Karol Rathaus' version (Op.42b) was first performed by the Ballet Russe in 1937 and in 1942 Francis Poulenc made it an episode in his ballet suite Les Animaux modèles (Op.111). It is also one of the 'short operas' in Ned Rorem's Fables (1971).


== Idioms ==
The title of the fable, both in English and French, was eventually to have an almost idiomatic force in reference to the pacification by love of the dominant male nature. As such it was given to two paintings which showed a soldier helping a young woman with her needlework. Abraham Solomon's, exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1858, depicted a grey-haired warrior in uniform trying to thread the needle of a lady seated beside him on a sofa, while the one by Emile Pierre Metzmacher (1815–1905), exhibited at the 
Exposition Universelle (1889), was a period piece in which a younger soldier tries his hand at tapestry.In literature the title was used for depiction of the emotional relationships of social lions. The novella by Frédéric Soulié (1839) is a comedy of manners that depicts the unequal love of a well-born dandy and its tragic outcome. Eugène Scribe's contemporary light-hearted comedy of 1840 is set in England, where a lord falls in love with his servant and, after attempting seduction and force, agrees to marry her. The verse drama by François Ponsard, first staged in 1866, was set in 1796, in the period following the Reign of Terror in France. A hero of the armies of the Revolution falls in love with a Royalist aristocrat whose father is plotting against the Republic and there is a struggle between duty and love on both sides. Its subtle dynamics encompass far more than 'trimming the hero's claws and filing his teeth', as a contemporary reviewer noted. Later examples of the title's use in English include the play by Shelagh Delaney (1960), about the marriage between a frustrated man and an aggressive woman, and a romance by Elizabeth Lapthorne (2004).The method for pacifying the lion also gave rise in the 19th century to the allied English idioms of 'to draw someone's teeth' and 'to cut, clip or pare someone's claws'. Their association with the fable is demonstrated by both being used together in a news report of 1831. Both have the meaning of rendering someone harmless.

It is numbered 332 in the Perry Index.  The story concerns a dog that bites the legs of others. Its master therefore ties a bell around its neck to warn people. The dog, thinking the bell is a reward, shows it off in the streets until an older dog reminds him that the bell is not a reward but a sign of disgrace. Victorian editors of the fables supplied the moral that 'notoriety is often mistaken for fame'.The Russian fabulist Ivan Krylov's story of ""The Ass"" is said to take its beginning from this fable. In his version, an ass is given a bell so that it can be traced if it wanders off.

Henryson fully exploited the fluid aspects of the tradition to produce an unusually sophisticated moral narrative, unique of its kind, making high art of an otherwise conventional genre.Internal evidence might suggest that the work was composed in or around the 1480s.


== The poem in context ==

Fable stories were a common trope in medieval and renaissance literature. They were told with the didactic intent of drawing moral lessons which could be either secular or spiritual. Many different versions of the stories were created but writers frequently followed understood conventions. One such convention was the inclusion of the didactic moral lesson in a moralitas (plural moralitates) inserted after the fable. Henryson follows and develops this convention.
By today's standards most surviving fable literature is gey dreich, partly because fable writing was a common classroom exercise. Students might be asked to learn fable plots to retell them in contracted or expanded form – modo brevitur and modo latius respectively – then give moral conclusions that could be judged or debated either on secular grounds (ethics, character, etc.) or by following more ""spiritual"" scholastic principles to do with homily and allegory. In this light, the Morall Fabillis can be viewed technically as a work of maximal modo latius.
Readers who were familiar with the genre may have found the tone, range and complexity of Henryson's attractive, variegated and interlinked fable elaboration unexpected, but the method was not without precedent. A similar ""trick"" with the genre is found in Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale, which is retold by Henryson as Fabill 3 in his sequence and is one of the poem's most directly identifiable sources. However, Henryson's sustained blending and blurring of the secular and the spiritual strands of the genre goes much further than Chaucer's largely secular example.


== Numbers and structure ==
The strong likelihood that Henryson employed Christian numerology in composing his works has been increasingly discussed in recent years. Use of number for compositional control was common in medieval poetics and could be intended to have religious symbolism, and features in the accepted text of the Morall Fabilliis indicate that this was elaborately applied in that poem.
The table below outlines the stanza count for each of the thirteen Fabillis in order. All thirteen of the fabillis has a taill (tale) and a moralitas. Four of the fabillis also have a prolog. The number of stanzas in each of these structural sections, as they apply, is shown in the table.
In addition, six of the fabillis in the cycle are tales based on Reynardian beast epic sources. These are denoted by the lighter colour. It can be noted that the distribution of these (in two groups of three embedded within the seven fabillis from Aesop) is symmetrical, and that the distribution of the prologs – some apparently introductory material embedded in the centre of the poem – may begin to make better sense when these larger structures are taken into account.


=== Stanza counts in Henryson's Morall Fabillis ===
Many commentators observe the central position of the taill in Fabill 7. The precision of this placing in terms of stanza count overall, however, is particularly notable. The Morall Fabillis consists of 424 stanzas overall, and the distribution of stanzas on either side of the central taill for fabill seven (the only one in the narrative of the cycle to be told directly by Aesop himself) is symmetrical, thus:

First half of the cycle: 200 stanzas
Central taill: 24 stanzas
Second half of the cycle: 200 stanzasIn the architecture of the poem the precise structural centre of the accepted text is the central taill: 200 + 24 + 200


=== The seven ballade stanzas ===
In addition, 4 stanzas near the beginning of the first half (#53-#56) and 3 stanzas towards the end of the second half (#417-#419) are composed in the eight-line ballade form, instead of the seven-line rhyme royal in which the rest of the cycle is written (without further exception). This means, in effect, the poem has an ""extra"" seven lines (or the equivalent of one more ""hidden"" rhyme royal stanza) distributed across its two-halves – 4 lines in the first, 3 lines in the second. The line count for the three principal divisions of the structure therefore comes out as: 

First half: 1404
Central taill: 168
Second half: 1403Making a total of 2795 lines.


=== Question of symmetry ===
Various literary scholars have noted the apparent symmetry in the architecture, citing it as evidence of an organising principle Henryson employed to ""lock"" the structure of the poem, aesthetically beautiful in its own right and holding important clues for interpreting his larger meaning or purpose. Others have preferred to defend individual readings of various fabillis viewed as self-sufficient entities which they argue question the coherence or completeness of that scheme. Finally John MacQueen cites fragmentation in surviving textual witnesses for the poem before 1570 as grounds for caution in asserting with certainty that the overall structure represents Henryson's intention. Nevertheless, the above outline describes the structure as received from the 16th century prints and manuscripts which give what the literary scholar Matthew McDiarmid calls the ""accepted text"".


== Place of Aesop in the fable sequence ==

The figure of Aesop is consistently cited throughout the poem as ""my author"" (my authority) by the narrator in those stories which are directly based on Aesopian sources. This usually occurs in the opening lines. However, one particularly distinctive feature of the poem is an appearance in person by Aesop himself. This occurs at the heart of the cycle within the prolog to Fabill 7. This presents the master fabulist meeting and conversing with the narrator (Henryson) in a dream vision. Aesop is also portrayed here as (by request of the narrator) directly telling the seventh fabill (The Taill of the Lyoun and the Mous) within this dream vision.
In contrast to more traditional portraits of Aesop as hunchbacked, this dream-vision version presents him as able-bodied. He is first met emerging ""sturdily"" from out of a schaw and immediately described as one of the ""fairest"" men the narrator has ""ever"" seen. A two-stanza portrait gives a detailed description of his appearance:

His gowne wes of ane claith als quhyte as milk,
His chymmeris wes of chambelate purpour broun,
His hude of scarlet, bordowrit weill with silk,
On heikillit wyis until his girdill doun,
His bonat round and of the auld fassoun,
His beird wes quhyte, his ene wes grit and gray,
With lokker hair quhilk over his schulderis lay.
Ane roll of paper in his hand he bair,
Ane swannis pen stikand under his eir,
Ane inkhorne with ane prettie gilt pennair,
Ane bag of silk, all at his belt can beir:
Thus wes he gudelie graithit in his geir,
Of stature large and with ane feirfull face.
Even quhair I lay he come ane sturdie pace,
And said, 'God speid, my sone...

(Robert Henryson, Morall Fabillis, lines 1347–1363)
Other Henrysonian variations from the traditional portrait include identifying Aesop as Roman rather than Greek, and as Christianised rather than pagan. It seems unlikely that these ""innovations"" were not consciously decided, although critics do not agree on how they are to be best interpreted.
There is no evidence that the portrait stood for Henryson himself, although the suggestion has sometimes been made. Henryson and Aesop remain quite distinct in the dialogue of the prologue. Moreover, Fabill 8 goes on to repeat the prologue device of Fabill 7, only this time to show the narrator himself (Henryson) telling the fable – one which has some less ideal and more ""realistic"" parallels – awake and in real time.


== Question of purpose ==
Henryson's contribution to the fable tradition is such a uniquely developed, subtly crafted and ambiguous example of a commonplace genre that it presents questions as to the poet's ultimate purpose in composition.


== The Thirteen Fabillis ==
The parts in this section give brief descriptions of each poem in the Morall Fabillis. You can also click the heading links to read separate main pages with fuller articles for each individual fabill.


=== Prolog and Fabill 1 ===

The poem which opens the Morall Fabillis is The Taill of the Cok and the Jasp. It has three parts: a prologue, the tale itself, and a moral.


==== Prolog ====
The Prolog introduces the whole cycle in principle, not merely the first fabill. It begins with a defence of the art of storytelling, argues that humour is a necessary part of life and tells the reader that the intention is to make a translation of Aesop from Latin.Fable translation was a standard classroom exercise in medieval Europe and the principal source for this was the Latin verse Romulus. Henryson's opening argument is, indeed, an expanded and re-orchestrated ""translation"" of the argument in the opening prologue of the Romulus text, but even from the start the poet far exceeds his commonplace ""commission"". He expands the unremarkable classroom material with an unusual degree of refinement, invention and cognisance, establishes a mature and personalised relationship with the reader, highlights Aesop's uncomfortably human context and hints at ambiguities. The prolog immediately foreshadows methods that the rest of the cycle will further develop.


==== Taill and moralitas ====

The first fabill in the Romulus text, De Gallo et Jaspide (The Cock and the Jewel), depicts a cockerel who rejects a valuable gemstone in preference for more precious grain. The Morall Fabillis opens with the same example. Although the fabill has no substantial story as such, Henryson's version quietly keeps the narrative promises made in the prolog by re-imagining the material as a strongly realised vignette, giving it a specific setting and hinting at a fully characterised cockerel. His artfulness subtly foreshadows the more fully fleshed stories yet to come (deferred tactics) but the adaption remains broadly conservative and the moralitas (moral; plural moralitates) comes down unreservedly against the cockerel on the grounds that the jewel represents wisdom rather than wealth. In the Romulus this judgement occurs in only two lines; Henryson, making the same case, states it with an almost unexpected force, taking five stanzas.
Despite providing the standard ""medieval"" closure on Aesop's ""riddle"", most modern critics note the way Henryson nevertheless seems to contrive an effect of dissonance between the fabill and the moralitas. Longer acquaintance may modify this view, but the impression remains of an opening poem that wants to establish layered modes of narration, introduce complexity and contrive to play with readers' expectations.


=== Fabill 2 ===

Fabill 2 (The Twa Mice) is a retelling of Aesop's Town Mouse and Country Mouse. Its purpose is to recommend and praise simple living. Henryson expands upon common versions of the story to create a succinct, fully fleshed narrative rich in incident and characterisation which fairly transcends its known sources while remaining faithful to the story's original elements. It is possibly one of the best known and most anthologised of his poems.
In context, Fabill 2 sets a standard for free narrative improvisation, coupled with close control and subtlety of inference, that will be sustained for the remainder of the larger cycle. At this point the adaptation is conservative, but other tales (e.g. Fabill 6) will make far less straightforward use of Aesop.


=== Fabill 3 ===

Fabill 3 (The Cock and the Fox) is the first Reynardian story in the Morall Fabillis and thus introduces the tod into the cycle. In various incarnations he is principal figure in the cycle after the wolf. Tod is a Scots word for fox and the poem interchangeably uses both terms. Henryson's tod is called Schir Lowrence.
The story in the fabill is an important adaptation of Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale. The successful conceit of Chaucer's poem was to create comic drama from a simple act of animal predation. Henryson's version condenses the main action, refines the psychology and introduces many variations, such as for instance its feature of three hens, Pertok, Sprutok and Toppok, each with distinctly contrasted characters.
Fabill 3 is the first in a sequence of three taillis (3, 4 and 5) which form a continuous narrative within the larger whole, the only section of the cycle to do this.


=== Fabill 4 ===

Fabill 4, The Confession of the Tod, ""The Taill of how this forsaid Tod maid his Confessioun to Freir Wolf Waitskaith"" (or ""The Confessioun of the Tod"") continues the story from the previous fabill and follows the fatal aventure and destinie of the tod after losing his prey. It is also the taill in which the wolf, the major figure of the cycle (in terms of number of times featured) first enters as a protagonist. It is also the second in a linked ""mini-cycle"" of three taillis in that poem which follows the fate of a family line of foxes. The principal action of the fabill revolves around rites of confession, penance and the remission of sins. These were all standard practice in the Scotland of Henryson's time.
The story picks up where the previous fable left off, as the Cock returns safe and happy to his family (it's still unknown what his wives think about it, though it's hinted that they are relieved he survived at all), but the fox, Lawrence, was starving as he waits until nightfall before his next hunt. When it gets dark, Lawrence, though he never been to college, had been gifted with knowledge enough to foresee his own future and that of his descendants by astrology, and after seeing the bad omens that align the planets with unfitting constellations, Lawrence comes to realize that unless he or one of his descendants could repent and amend himself or wrongdoings, he and his family (as the fate of all foxes, but worse to compare) will be shamed forever with the ""cursed life of a thief"", which is said to be so horrible that it orphans each new generation as the last one is sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. Thinking himself a lost cause, Lawrence the fox, in the light of dawn, sees Friar Wolf Waitskaith and assumes that admitting sin in the presence of this assumingly holy man would help free himself. The friar Wolf is pleased as the fox admits to lying, stealing, adultery, and even exaggerates by mentioning murder (few as his successful hunting-and-killings may be). After that, Lawrence the fox, believing himself cleansed of his wrongs, fears doing so again, as he is from a povertous family, and is too proud to work or beg for his meals, but upon Friar Wolf suggesting he fast and eat nothing with flesh until Easter, Lawrence resorts to begging to be an exception to the custom. The friar granted it, but suggested that it would be only fish from the stream at least once or twice a week. Lawrence takes the advice gracefully, but then finds the new practice difficult as he has no net, pole, or boat to fish with properly, and so has to keep swiping at the water and missing his catch. Upon one of these unsuccessful fishing trips, the fox sees a fat lamb had strayed from the flock, and driven by hunger, he cannot resist pouncing on it. While the lamb survived the incident, the shepherd caught Lawrence the fox in the act of attempting to kill it, and although he said that he was ""only kidding"" and pleads he'd never do it again, the fox meets his end by a single, unmerciful blow from the shepherd. (the next story is the official beginning of Reynard's tale, as he faces trial for his father's sins.)

In Henryson's day, the wolf was still a native creature to Scotland.


=== Fabill 5 ===
Fabill 5 (The Trial of the Tod) is the third Reynardian tale in the Morall Fabillis. Schir Lowrence is dead and his carcase disposed of without ceremony in a bog (a peat pot) by his bastard son who relishes the opportunity to ring and raxe intill his (faitheris) steid.
The young tod's hopes are checked by the arrival of the Royal Court of the Lion and the command that all the animals must appear at a regal tribunall. After trying to ""hide at the back"", Lowrence is called forward and sent, along with a rather incompetent wolf, to serve a summons on a mare who has failed to appear before the lion. There is much brutal action in the subsequent ""comic"" story. Despite efforts to avoid justice, Lowrence ultimately does not escape standing trial and being sentenced for his crimes.

At fifty stanzas, The Trial of the Tod is the longest poem in the cycle.


=== Fabill 6 ===
Fabill 6 (The Sheep and the Dog) is the third of the Aesopian tales in the Morall Fabillis. Of the thirteen poems in the cycle, it is one of the most starkly written and the adaptation of its source (Aesop's The Sheep and the Dog) is not at all straightforward. Henryson's version portrays the relationship between the two figures in terms of a trial. The sheep is required to submit to a long, complex, unethically convened judicial process so that the dog may procure recompense for ""stolen"" bread. The sheep loses the case, is stripped of his fleece and left to face the winter elements unprotected. The action of the fabill carries over into the moralitas in which the sheep questions whether God's justice is detectable on earth.
Although Henryson's sixth fabill is not linked to the previous one in direct narrative terms, it is notable that both involve a trial and feature what seem to be, on the surface, contrasting visions of human justice.


=== Core prolog and Fabill 7 ===

Fabill 7 (The Lion and the Mouse) is a straightforward but rich expansion of Esope's well-known The Lion and the Mouse in which the lion who reprieves the mouse he has captured is, in return, rescued by the mouse after himself becoming ensnared. Some commentators have noted that the section which describes the imprisonment of the lion is described in terms which plausibly evokes identifiable political events during the reign of James III.
As the central poem in the accepted text of the cycle overall, it has a number of unusual features. Firstly, there is a long prolog which introduces both the narrator and Esope as protagonists directly into the poem as part of the framing action for the fabill. Secondly, the taill is told directly by Esope within the narrator's dream (the narrator meets Esope as part of a dream vision). The moralitas is also delivered by Esope. Thirdly, it is the only fabill in the cycle to have an unambiguously ideal outcome in which all parties have gained.
The plea that the mouse makes for the lion to temper mercy with justice is a long one (10 stanzas) and invokes important civil, legal and spiritual concepts.


=== Fabill 8 ===

Fabill 8 (The Preaching of the Swallow) is widely regarded as being one of Henryson's finest poems. Like Fabill 7 it has a prolog which introduces the narrator directly into the poem, but this time he remains awake and witnesses the story himself (also reporting it himself) as real-time action in the world. The source for the story he ""witnesses"" is Esope's The Owl and the Birds, a parable in which the wisest of the birds (the owl) counsels all the rest to remove or avoid features in the world which are mortal to their kind. Henryson changes the protagonist to a swallow and the avian danger he selects is flax production, identified for its role in making fowlers' nets.


=== Fabill 9 ===
Fabill 9 (The Fox, the Wolf and the Cadger) is the first of the second set of three Reynardian taillis in the poem. It presents the wolf for the first time in his true fabill colours as a ruthless and lordly predator demanding obeisance. The tod similarly manifests as a wily trickster who (in contrast to the first half of the cycle) completely succeeds in outwitting his victims. The business also involves a human character as a full protagonist.
At the beginning of the taill, the wolf recruits Lowrence into his service. The fox either is, or pretends to be, reluctant but appears to have no choice. While in service, Lowrence opportunistically plants in his master a desire for the largest and most valuable fish (the mysterious ""nekhering"") from the cart of a passing fish merchant (the cadger) and uses his ""demonstration"" of how it can be stolen as a single ploy to outwit both the wolf and the man.
The plot of this and the next fabill, which have many parallels and ring many changes, both explore the complex relationship between the wolf, the fox and a man.


=== Fabill 10 ===
Fabill 10 (The Fox, the Wolf and the Husbandman), like the fabill before, is the story of a fox who pretends to serve the best interests of a wolf. Again it fully involves a human character in its action and this time even opens with the man as a protagonist.
This time the interest which the fox purports to defend is the wolf's claim on the husbandman's cattle. The case is presented to the man (who is both surprised and fearful at the development) suddenly while on the road at dusk and he has considerable difficulty in countering the wolf's claim. The tod plays the part of lawyer for both the defence and the prosecution, contriving that the man, in effect, keeps his cattle for a bribe. The wolf is then bought off with a trick similar to Fabill 9, only this time, the planted desire is for a non-existent kebbuck and the wolf ends up stranded at the bottom of a well at midnight.


=== Fabill 11 ===
Fabill 11 (The Wolf and the Wether) opens, like Fabill 10, with a human protagonist (the shepherd) but its principal action involves a sheep in a dog skin who believes he is able to guard the rest of the flock from the wolf. The story, in terms of the protagonists, is a complete reversal of Esope's fable The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, although the outcome is essentially the same. Because it is the well-meaning sheep that is destroyed at the end of the fabill (rather than the wolf, as happens in the source) the moralitas, which is short and focusses all the condemnation on the sheep, does not feel like a fair or complete account of the action. The surface message is a profoundly conservative warning to stick to one's station in life.


=== Fabill 12 ===
Fabill 12 (The Wolf and the Lamb) similarly involves the characters of the wolf and a sheep, but this time it is a more straightforward expansion of The Wolf and the Lamb, one of Esope's bleakest ""stories"". As in Fabill 11, the wolf pitilessly kills his victim. This time, however, the narrator's response in the moralitas (10 stanzas – the longest in the cycle) – is, or seems to be, completely different in terms of sympathies and more impassioned on the theme of social, political and legal injustice.


=== Fabill 13 and Conclusion ===

Fabill 13 (The Paddock and the Mouse) is the final poem in the Morall Fabillis. It closes the cycle with a reintroduction of the figure of the mouse which also featured close to the beginning (in Fabill 2) and in the central poem (Fabill 7). The final stanzas of the moralitas also act as a conclusion to the cycle.
The fabill is a straightforward and rich expansion of Aesop's The Frog and the Mouse.

<p><i><b>The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian</b></i> is a work of Northern Renaissance literature composed in Middle Scots by the fifteenth century Scottish makar, Robert Henryson. It is a cycle of thirteen connected narrative poems based on fables from the European tradition. The drama of the cycle exploits a set of complex moral dilemmas through the figure of animals representing a full range of human psychology. As the work progresses, the stories and situations become increasingly dark. 
</p><p>The overall structure of the <i>Morall Fabillis</i> is symmetrical, with seven stories modelled on fables from Aesop (from the elegiac Romulus manuscripts, medieval Europe's standard fable text, written in Latin), interspersed by six others in two groups of three drawn from the more profane beast epic tradition. All the expansions are rich, wry and highly developed. The central poem of the cycle takes the form of a dream vision in which the narrator meets Aesop in person. Aesop tells the fable <i>The Lion and the Mouse</i> within the dream, and the structure of the poem is contrived so that this fable occupies the precise central position of the work.
</p><p>Five of the six poems in the two 'beast epic' sections of the cycle feature the Reynardian trickster figure of the fox. Henryson styles the fox – in Scots the tod – as <i>Lowrence</i>. The two 'beast epic' sections of the poem (one in each half) also explore a developing relationship between Lowrence and the figure of the wolf. The wolf features in a number of different guises, including that of a Friar, and similarly appears in five out of the six stories. The wolf then makes a sixth and final appearance towards the end, stepping out of the 'beast epic' section to intrude most brutally in the penultimate poem of the 'Aesopic' sections.
</p><p>The subtle and ambiguous way in which Henryson adapted and juxtaposed material from a diversity of sources in the tradition and exploited anthropomorphic conventions to blend human characteristics with animal observation both worked within, and pushed the bounds of, standard practice in the common medieval art of fable re-telling. Henryson fully exploited the fluid aspects of the tradition to produce an unusually sophisticated moral narrative, unique of its kind, making high art of an otherwise conventional genre.</p><p>Internal evidence might suggest that the work was composed in or around the 1480s.

<h2><span id=""The_poem_in_context"">The poem in context</span></h2>

<p>Fable stories were a common trope in medieval and renaissance literature. They were told with the didactic intent of drawing moral lessons which could be either secular or spiritual. Many different versions of the stories were created but writers frequently followed understood conventions. One such convention was the inclusion of the didactic moral lesson in a moralitas (plural <i>moralitates</i>) inserted after the fable. Henryson follows and develops this convention.
</p><p>By today's standards most surviving fable literature is gey dreich, partly because fable writing was a common classroom exercise. Students might be asked to learn fable plots to retell them in contracted or expanded form – <i>modo brevitur</i> and <i>modo latius</i> respectively – then give moral conclusions that could be judged or debated either on secular grounds (ethics, character, etc.) or by following more ""spiritual"" scholastic principles to do with homily and allegory. In this light, the <i>Morall Fabillis</i> can be viewed technically as a work of maximal <i>modo latius</i>.
</p><p>Readers who were familiar with the genre may have found the tone, range and complexity of Henryson's attractive, variegated and interlinked fable elaboration unexpected, but the method was not without precedent. A similar ""trick"" with the genre is found in Chaucer's Nun's Priest's Tale, which is retold by Henryson as Fabill 3 in his sequence and is one of the poem's most directly identifiable <i>sources</i>. However, Henryson's sustained blending and blurring of the secular and the spiritual strands of the genre goes much further than Chaucer's largely secular example.
</p>
<h2><span id=""Numbers_and_structure"">Numbers and structure</span></h2>
<p>The strong likelihood that Henryson employed Christian numerology in composing his works has been increasingly discussed in recent years. Use of number for compositional control was common in medieval poetics and could be intended to have religious symbolism, and features in the accepted text of the <i>Morall Fabilliis</i> indicate that this was elaborately applied in that poem.
</p><p>The table below outlines the stanza count for each of the thirteen Fabillis in order. All thirteen of the fabillis has a <i>taill</i> (tale) and a <i>moralitas</i>. Four of the fabillis also have a <i>prolog</i>. The number of stanzas in each of these structural sections, as they apply, is shown in the table.
</p><p>In addition, six of the fabillis in the cycle are tales based on Reynardian beast epic sources. These are denoted by the lighter colour. It can be noted that the distribution of these (in two groups of three embedded within the seven fabillis from Aesop) is symmetrical, and that the distribution of the prologs – some apparently introductory material embedded in the centre of the poem – may begin to make better sense when these larger structures are taken into account.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Stanza_counts_in_Henryson.27s_Morall_Fabillis""></span><span id=""Stanza_counts_in_Henryson's_Morall_Fabillis"">Stanza counts in Henryson's <i>Morall Fabillis</i></span></h3>
<p>Many commentators observe the central position of the taill in <b>Fabill 7</b>. The precision of this placing in terms of stanza count overall, however, is particularly notable. <b>The Morall Fabillis</b> consists of <b>424</b> stanzas overall, and the distribution of stanzas on either side of the central <i>taill</i> for fabill seven (the only one in the narrative of the cycle to be told directly by Aesop himself) is symmetrical, thus:
</p>
<ul><li>First half of the cycle: 200 stanzas</li>
<li>Central <i>taill</i>: 24 stanzas</li>
<li>Second half of the cycle: 200 stanzas</li></ul><p>In the architecture of the poem the precise structural centre of the accepted text is the central <i>taill</i>: <b>200 + 24 + 200</b>
</p>
<h3><span id=""The_seven_ballade_stanzas"">The seven ballade stanzas</span></h3>
<p>In addition, <b>4</b> stanzas near the beginning of the first half (#53-#56) and <b>3</b> stanzas towards the end of the second half (#417-#419) are composed in the eight-line ballade form, instead of the seven-line rhyme royal in which the rest of the cycle is written (without further exception). This means, in effect, the poem has an ""extra"" seven lines (or the equivalent of one more ""hidden"" rhyme royal stanza) distributed across its two-halves – 4 lines in the first, 3 lines in the second. The line count for the three principal divisions of the structure therefore comes out as: 
</p>
<ul><li>First half: 1404</li>
<li>Central taill: 168</li>
<li>Second half: 1403</li></ul><p>Making a total of 2795 lines.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Question_of_symmetry"">Question of symmetry</span></h3>
<p>Various literary scholars have noted the apparent symmetry in the architecture, citing it as evidence of an organising principle Henryson employed to ""lock"" the structure of the poem, aesthetically beautiful in its own right and holding important clues for interpreting his larger meaning or purpose. Others have preferred to defend individual readings of various fabillis viewed as self-sufficient entities which they argue question the coherence or completeness of that scheme. Finally John MacQueen cites fragmentation in surviving textual witnesses for the poem before 1570 as grounds for caution in asserting with certainty that the overall structure represents Henryson's intention. Nevertheless, the above outline describes the structure as received from the 16th century prints and manuscripts which give what the literary scholar Matthew McDiarmid calls the ""accepted text"".</p>
<h2><span id=""Place_of_Aesop_in_the_fable_sequence"">Place of Aesop in the fable sequence</span></h2>

<p>The figure of Aesop is consistently cited throughout the poem as ""my author"" (my authority) by the narrator in those stories which are directly based on Aesopian sources. This usually occurs in the opening lines. However, one particularly distinctive feature of the poem is an appearance in person by Aesop himself. This occurs at the heart of the cycle within the <i>prolog</i> to <i>Fabill 7</i>. This presents the master fabulist meeting and conversing with the narrator (Henryson) in a dream vision. Aesop is also portrayed here as (by request of the narrator) directly telling the seventh fabill (<i>The Taill of the Lyoun and the Mous</i>) within this dream vision.
</p><p>In contrast to more traditional portraits of Aesop as hunchbacked, this dream-vision version presents him as able-bodied. He is first met emerging ""sturdily"" from out of a <i>schaw</i> and immediately described as one of the ""fairest"" men the narrator has ""ever"" seen. A two-stanza portrait gives a detailed description of his appearance:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His gowne wes of ane claith als quhyte as milk,<br>
His chymmeris wes of chambelate purpour broun,<br>
His hude of scarlet, bordowrit weill with silk,<br>
On heikillit wyis until his girdill doun,<br>
His bonat round and of the auld fassoun,<br>
His beird wes quhyte, his ene wes grit and gray,<br>
With lokker hair quhilk over his schulderis lay.<br><br>
Ane roll of paper in his hand he bair,<br>
Ane swannis pen stikand under his eir,<br>
Ane inkhorne with ane prettie gilt pennair,<br>
Ane bag of silk, all at his belt can beir:<br>
Thus wes he gudelie graithit in his geir,<br>
Of stature large and with ane feirfull face.<br>
Even quhair I lay he come ane sturdie pace,<br><br>
And said, 'God speid, my sone...<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Robert Henryson, <i>Morall Fabillis</i>, lines 1347–1363)
</p><p>Other Henrysonian variations from the traditional portrait include identifying Aesop as Roman rather than Greek, and as Christianised rather than pagan. It seems unlikely that these ""innovations"" were not consciously decided, although critics do not agree on how they are to be best interpreted.
</p><p>There is no evidence that the portrait stood for Henryson himself, although the suggestion has sometimes been made. Henryson and Aesop remain quite distinct in the dialogue of the prologue. Moreover, <i>Fabill 8</i> goes on to repeat the prologue device of Fabill 7, only this time to show the narrator himself (Henryson) telling the fable – one which has some less ideal and more ""realistic"" parallels – awake and in real time.
</p>
<h2><span id=""Question_of_purpose"">Question of purpose</span></h2>
<p>Henryson's contribution to the fable tradition is such a uniquely developed, subtly crafted and ambiguous example of a commonplace genre that it presents questions as to the poet's ultimate purpose in composition.

</p>
<h3><span id=""Prolog_and_Fabill_1"">Prolog and Fabill 1</span></h3>

<p>The poem which opens the <i><b>Morall Fabillis</b></i> is <i>The Taill of the Cok and the Jasp</i>. It has three parts: a prologue, the tale itself, and a moral.
</p>
<h4><span id=""Prolog"">Prolog</span></h4>
<p>The <b>Prolog</b> introduces the whole cycle in principle, not merely the first fabill. It begins with a defence of the art of storytelling, argues that humour is a necessary part of life and tells the reader that the intention is to make a translation of Aesop from Latin.</p><p>Fable translation was a standard classroom exercise in medieval Europe and the principal source for this was the Latin <i>verse Romulus</i>. Henryson's opening argument is, indeed, an expanded and re-orchestrated ""translation"" of the argument in the opening prologue of the <i>Romulus</i> text, but even from the start the poet far exceeds his commonplace ""commission"". He expands the unremarkable classroom material with an unusual degree of refinement, invention and cognisance, establishes a mature and personalised relationship with the reader, highlights Aesop's uncomfortably human context and hints at ambiguities. The prolog immediately foreshadows methods that the rest of the cycle will further develop.
</p>
<h4><span id=""Taill_and_moralitas"">Taill and moralitas</span></h4>

<p>The first fabill in the <i>Romulus</i> text, <i>De Gallo et Jaspide</i> (<i>The Cock and the Jewel</i>), depicts a cockerel who rejects a valuable gemstone in preference for more precious grain. <i>The Morall Fabillis</i> opens with the same example. Although the fabill has no substantial story as such, Henryson's version quietly keeps the narrative promises made in the prolog by re-imagining the material as a strongly realised vignette, giving it a specific setting and hinting at a fully characterised cockerel. His artfulness subtly foreshadows the more fully fleshed stories yet to come (deferred tactics) but the adaption remains broadly conservative and the <i><b>moralitas</b></i> (moral; plural <i>moralitates</i>) comes down unreservedly <i>against</i> the cockerel on the grounds that the jewel represents wisdom rather than wealth. In the <i>Romulus</i> this judgement occurs in only two lines; Henryson, making the same case, states it with an almost unexpected force, taking five stanzas.
</p><p>Despite providing the standard ""medieval"" closure on Aesop's ""riddle"", most modern critics note the way Henryson nevertheless seems to contrive an effect of dissonance between the fabill and the moralitas. Longer acquaintance may modify this view, but the impression remains of an opening poem that wants to establish layered modes of narration, introduce complexity and contrive to play with readers' expectations.</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_2"">Fabill 2</span></h3>

<p><i><b>Fabill 2</b></i> (<i>The Twa Mice</i>) is a retelling of Aesop's <i>Town Mouse and Country Mouse.</i> Its purpose is to recommend and praise simple living. Henryson expands upon common versions of the story to create a succinct, fully fleshed narrative rich in incident and characterisation which fairly transcends its known sources while remaining faithful to the story's original elements. It is possibly one of the best known and most anthologised of his poems.
</p><p>In context, <i>Fabill 2</i> sets a standard for free narrative improvisation, coupled with close control and subtlety of inference, that will be sustained for the remainder of the larger cycle. At this point the adaptation is conservative, but other tales (e.g. <i>Fabill 6</i>) will make far less straightforward use of Aesop.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_3"">Fabill 3</span></h3>

<p><i><b>Fabill 3</b></i> (<i>The Cock and the Fox</i>) is the first Reynardian story in the <i><b>Morall Fabillis</b></i> and thus introduces the tod into the cycle. In various incarnations he is principal figure in the cycle after the wolf. Tod is a Scots word for <i>fox</i> and the poem interchangeably uses both terms. Henryson's tod is called <i>Schir Lowrence.</i>
</p><p>The story in the fabill is an important adaptation of Chaucer's <i>Nun's Priest's Tale.</i> The successful conceit of Chaucer's poem was to create comic drama from a simple act of animal predation. Henryson's version condenses the main action, refines the psychology and introduces many variations, such as for instance its feature of three hens, Pertok, Sprutok and Toppok, each with distinctly contrasted characters.
</p><p><i>Fabill 3</i> is the first in a sequence of three taillis (3, 4 and 5) which form a continuous narrative within the larger whole, the only section of the cycle to do this.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_4"">Fabill 4</span></h3>

<p><i><b>Fabill 4</b></i>, <b>The Confession of the Tod</b>, ""<b>The Taill of how this forsaid Tod maid his Confessioun to Freir Wolf Waitskaith</b>"" (or ""<b>The Confessioun of the Tod</b>"") continues the story from the previous fabill and follows the <i>fatal aventure and destinie</i> of the tod after losing his prey. It is also the taill in which the wolf, the major figure of the cycle (in terms of number of times featured) first enters as a protagonist. It is also the second in a linked ""mini-cycle"" of three <i>taillis</i> in that poem which follows the fate of a family line of foxes. The principal action of the fabill revolves around rites of confession, penance and the remission of sins. These were all standard practice in the Scotland of Henryson's time.
</p><p>The story picks up where the previous fable left off, as the Cock returns safe and happy to his family (it's still unknown what his wives think about it, though it's hinted that they are relieved he survived at all), but the fox, Lawrence, was starving as he waits until nightfall before his next hunt. When it gets dark, Lawrence, though he never been to college, had been gifted with knowledge enough to foresee his own future and that of his descendants by astrology, and after seeing the bad omens that align the planets with unfitting constellations, Lawrence comes to realize that unless he or one of his descendants could repent and amend himself or wrongdoings, he and his family (as the fate of all foxes, but worse to compare) will be shamed forever with the ""cursed life of a thief"", which is said to be so horrible that it orphans each new generation as the last one is sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. Thinking himself a lost cause, Lawrence the fox, in the light of dawn, sees Friar Wolf Waitskaith and assumes that admitting sin in the presence of this assumingly holy man would help free himself. The friar Wolf is pleased as the fox admits to lying, stealing, adultery, and even exaggerates by mentioning murder (few as his successful hunting-and-killings may be). After that, Lawrence the fox, believing himself cleansed of his wrongs, fears doing so again, as he is from a povertous family, and is too proud to work or beg for his meals, but upon Friar Wolf suggesting he fast and eat nothing with flesh until Easter, Lawrence resorts to begging to be an exception to the custom. The friar granted it, but suggested that it would be only fish from the stream at least once or twice a week. Lawrence takes the advice gracefully, but then finds the new practice difficult as he has no net, pole, or boat to fish with properly, and so has to keep swiping at the water and missing his catch. Upon one of these unsuccessful fishing trips, the fox sees a fat lamb had strayed from the flock, and driven by hunger, he cannot resist pouncing on it. While the lamb survived the incident, the shepherd caught Lawrence the fox in the act of attempting to kill it, and although he said that he was ""only kidding"" and pleads he'd never do it again, the fox meets his end by a single, unmerciful blow from the shepherd. (the next story is the official beginning of Reynard's tale, as he faces trial for his father's sins.)
</p><p><br>
In Henryson's day, the wolf was still a native creature to Scotland.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_5"">Fabill 5</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Fabill 5</b></i> (<i>The Trial of the Tod</i>) is the third Reynardian tale in the <i><b>Morall Fabillis.</b></i> Schir Lowrence is dead and his carcase disposed of without ceremony in a bog (a <i>peat pot</i>) by his bastard son who relishes the opportunity to <i>ring and raxe intill his (faitheris) steid.</i>
</p><p>The young tod's hopes are checked by the arrival of the Royal Court of the <i>Lion</i> and the command that all the animals must appear at a regal tribunall. After trying to ""hide at the back"", Lowrence is called forward and sent, along with a rather incompetent wolf, to serve a summons on a mare who has failed to appear before the lion. There is much brutal action in the subsequent ""comic"" story. Despite efforts to avoid justice, Lowrence ultimately does not escape standing trial and being sentenced for his crimes.
</p>

<p>At fifty stanzas, <i>The Trial of the Tod</i> is the longest poem in the cycle.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_6"">Fabill 6</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Fabill 6</b></i> (<i>The Sheep and the Dog</i>) is the third of the Aesopian tales in the <i><b>Morall Fabillis.</b></i> Of the thirteen poems in the cycle, it is one of the most starkly written and the adaptation of its source (Aesop's <i>The Sheep and the Dog</i>) is not at all straightforward. Henryson's version portrays the relationship between the two figures in terms of a trial. The sheep is required to submit to a long, complex, unethically convened judicial process so that the dog may procure recompense for ""stolen"" bread. The sheep loses the case, is stripped of his fleece and left to face the winter elements unprotected. The action of the fabill carries over into the moralitas in which the sheep questions whether God's justice is detectable on earth.
</p><p>Although Henryson's sixth fabill is not linked to the previous one in direct narrative terms, it is notable that both involve a trial and feature what seem to be, on the surface, contrasting visions of human justice.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Core_prolog_and_Fabill_7"">Core prolog and Fabill 7</span></h3>

<p><i><b>Fabill 7</b></i> (<i>The Lion and the Mouse</i>) is a straightforward but rich expansion of Esope's well-known <i>The Lion and the Mouse</i> in which the lion who reprieves the mouse he has captured is, in return, rescued by the mouse after himself becoming ensnared. Some commentators have noted that the section which describes the imprisonment of the lion is described in terms which plausibly evokes identifiable political events during the reign of James III.
</p><p>As the central poem in the accepted text of the cycle overall, it has a number of unusual features. Firstly, there is a long <i>prolog</i> which introduces both the narrator and Esope as protagonists directly into the poem as part of the framing action for the fabill. Secondly, the taill is told directly by Esope within the narrator's dream (the narrator meets Esope as part of a dream vision). The moralitas is also delivered by Esope. Thirdly, it is the only fabill in the cycle to have an unambiguously ideal outcome in which all parties have gained.
</p><p>The plea that the mouse makes for the lion to temper mercy with justice is a long one (10 stanzas) and invokes important civil, legal and spiritual concepts.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_8"">Fabill 8</span></h3>


<p><i><b>Fabill 8</b></i> (<i>The Preaching of the Swallow</i>) is widely regarded as being one of Henryson's finest poems. Like <i>Fabill 7</i> it has a prolog which introduces the narrator directly into the poem, but this time he remains awake and witnesses the story himself (also reporting it himself) as real-time action in the world. The source for the story he ""witnesses"" is Esope's <i>The Owl and the Birds</i>, a parable in which the wisest of the birds (the owl) counsels all the rest to remove or avoid features in the world which are mortal to their kind. Henryson changes the protagonist to a swallow and the avian danger he selects is flax production, identified for its role in making fowlers' nets.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_9"">Fabill 9</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Fabill 9</b></i> (<i>The Fox, the Wolf and the Cadger</i>) is the first of the second set of three Reynardian taillis in the poem. It presents the wolf for the first time in his true fabill colours as a ruthless and lordly predator demanding obeisance. The tod similarly manifests as a wily trickster who (in contrast to the first half of the cycle) completely succeeds in outwitting his victims. The business also involves a human character as a full protagonist.
</p><p>At the beginning of the taill, the wolf recruits Lowrence into his service. The fox either is, or pretends to be, reluctant but appears to have no choice. While in service, Lowrence opportunistically plants in his master a desire for the largest and most valuable fish (the mysterious ""nekhering"") from the cart of a passing fish merchant (the cadger) and uses his ""demonstration"" of how it can be stolen as a single ploy to outwit both the wolf and the man.
</p><p>The plot of this and the next fabill, which have many parallels and ring many changes, both explore the complex relationship between the wolf, the fox and a man.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_10"">Fabill 10</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Fabill 10</b></i> (<i>The Fox, the Wolf and the Husbandman</i>), like the fabill before, is the story of a fox who pretends to serve the best interests of a wolf. Again it fully involves a human character in its action and this time even opens with the man as a protagonist.
</p><p>This time the interest which the fox purports to defend is the wolf's claim on the husbandman's cattle. The case is presented to the man (who is both surprised and fearful at the development) suddenly while on the road at dusk and he has considerable difficulty in countering the wolf's claim. The tod plays the part of lawyer for both the defence and the prosecution, contriving that the man, in effect, keeps his cattle for a bribe. The wolf is then bought off with a trick similar to <i>Fabill 9,</i> only this time, the planted desire is for a non-existent kebbuck and the wolf ends up stranded at the bottom of a well at midnight.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_11"">Fabill 11</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Fabill 11</b></i> (<i>The Wolf and the Wether</i>) opens, like <i>Fabill 10,</i> with a human protagonist (the shepherd) but its principal action involves a sheep in a dog skin who believes he is able to guard the rest of the flock from the wolf. The story, in terms of the protagonists, is a complete reversal of Esope's fable <i>The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</i>, although the outcome is essentially the same. Because it is the well-meaning sheep that is destroyed at the end of the fabill (rather than the wolf, as happens in the source) the moralitas, which is short and focusses all the condemnation on the sheep, does not feel like a fair or complete account of the action. The surface message is a profoundly conservative warning to stick to one's station in life.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_12"">Fabill 12</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Fabill 12</b></i> (<i>The Wolf and the Lamb</i>) similarly involves the characters of the wolf and a sheep, but this time it is a more straightforward expansion of <i>The Wolf and the Lamb</i>, one of Esope's bleakest ""stories"". As in <i>Fabill 11,</i> the wolf pitilessly kills his victim. This time, however, the narrator's response in the moralitas (10 stanzas – the longest in the cycle) – is, or seems to be, completely different in terms of sympathies and more impassioned on the theme of social, political and legal injustice.
</p>
<h3><span id=""Fabill_13_and_Conclusion"">Fabill 13 and Conclusion</span></h3>

<p><i><b>Fabill 13</b></i> (<i>The Paddock and the Mouse</i>) is the final poem in the <i><b>Morall Fabillis.</b></i> It closes the cycle with a reintroduction of the figure of the mouse which also featured close to the beginning (in <i>Fabill 2</i>) and in the central poem (<i>Fabill 7</i>). The final stanzas of the moralitas also act as a conclusion to the cycle.
</p><p>The fabill is a straightforward and rich expansion of Aesop's <i>The Frog and the Mouse.</i>

In more modern times the satirical intention behind the fable was given greater emphasis following Jean de la Fontaine's interpretation of it. Illustrations to the text underlined its ironical application particularly and went on to influence cartoons referring to the fable elsewhere in Europe and America.


== The Classical fable ==
The earliest surviving version of the tale is in the first two and a half lines of a four-line Latin poem by Phaedrus: ""A mountain had gone into labour and was groaning terribly. Such rumours excited great expectations all over the country. In the end, however, the mountain gave birth to a mouse."" Phaedrus then went on to say that this applies to those who make serious but empty threats. 
But the most well-known mention of the fable appears in Horace's epistle on The Art of Poetry. Discussing what to avoid in a poem's opening, he recommends

And don’t start like the old writer of epic cycles:
‘Of Priam’s fate I’ll sing, and the greatest of Wars.’
What could he produce to match his opening promise?
Mountains will labour: what’s born? A ridiculous mouse!
(Ars Poetica, 136–9)A number of writers of Greek origin alluded to the fable without relating it. Plutarch described it as an ""old proverb"", while Porphyry claimed that it was a Greek proverb that Horace had been quoting.


== Mediaeval interpretations ==
During the Middle Ages the fable was retold many times without significant variation. The moral, however, was differently expressed and widened to specify a variety of circumstances to which it could be applied.
One of the Anglo-Latin prose collections going under the name Romulus gives a more extended interpretation, commenting that it warns one not to believe big talk, ""for there are some who promise many more things than they deliver, and some who threaten much and perform least"". This was more or less the conclusion on which William Caxton closed his ambiguous adaptation of the story as ""a hylle whiche beganne to tremble and shake by cause of the molle whiche delved hit"". There was, however, a closer English-language version of the fable told earlier by John Gower in his Confessio Amantis (c.1390), with the advice not to be taken in by every empty rumour.The actual line from Horace's poem (Parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus) was reproduced word for word in another mediaeval compilation of fables, the Ysopet-Avionnet. In this instance, however, the allusion was in connection with the different fable about Belling the cat, which has as subject the ineffectiveness of political dialogue.


== Literature and politics ==
Two French poets followed Horace in applying the story to literary criticism. In the case of Nicolas Boileau, he was imitating the Roman poet’s Ars Poetica in an Art Poétique (1674) of his own and made the allusion in much the same terms as had Horace. The words on which he closed, La montagne en travail enfante une souris (The mountain in labour gives birth to a mouse), soon became proverbial and were applied to any great hope that came to nothing. In the version of the tale published in 1668 in La Fontaine's Fables (V.10), the first six lines are given to an updated relation in which it is imagined that the mountain is about to be delivered of a city bigger than Paris. That is followed by eight lines of reflection on the kind of author who promises great things although, as Norman Shapiro translates it, ""What often comes to pass? – Just gas."" La Fontaine’s rhymed short line at the end imitates the vowel assonance of Horace's ridiculus mus in the original Latin. The title that La Fontaine gave this fable was La montagne qui accouche (The mountain giving birth), thus putting more emphasis on the situation rather than, as in Boileau, on the result.
Other poets shortly followed La Fontaine’s lead in applying the fable to boastful authors. In his Nouveau recueil des fables d'Esope mises en français, avec le sens moral en quatre vers (1678), Isaac de Benserade provided an introductory prose version of the fable, succeeded by a dismissive quatrain which ended with a repetition of Boileau’s pithy line, La montagne en travail enfante une souris.  A German poet too, Friedrich von Hagedorn, imitated La Fontaine’s fable in his 1738 collection Fabeln und Erzählungen. There, in Der Berg und der Poet (The Mountain and the Poet), he introduced a rhymster big with an epic idea: but ""What arrives embroidered upon it? Like the mouse from a mountain, a sonnet."" And when Lord Byron was updating allusions in his Hints from Horace (1811), he substituted a reference to a contemporary writer of bad epics, Robert Southey, ""Whose epic mountains never fail in mice"".Samuel Croxall, in his prose retelling of the fable, cites ""Great cry and little wool"" as a parallel English proverb and applies the story to the empty promises of politicians. French writers too interpreted the fable in political terms. Eugène Desmares wrote an imitation of all La Fontaine’s fables as Les métamorphoses du jour: ou, La Fontaine en 1831 in order to comment on the situation at the start of Louis Philippe I's reign. There ""La Revolution qui accouche"" addressed itself to disappointed expectations. Following the removal of Louis Philippe in 1848 and the declaration of a French Second Republic, the new political situation was again satirised in a one-act vaudeville, titled after the fable and written by Varin and Arthur de Beauplan.

=== Illustrations ===
La Fontaine had emphasised the satirical intent in Horace’s original allusion to the fable of the mountain in labour, amplifying the ridiculousness of the situation. His illustrators were soon to follow suit. Jean-Baptiste Oudry's print of 1752 balances the agitated folk scurrying over the mountain slopes to the right with the mouse creeping warily over the rock face opposite. Gustave Doré broadens the satire with a parallel literary reference. In his 1867 engraving, Don Quixote is seated on an opposite ridge, expounding his surmises concerning the tremendous outcome expected to Sancho Panza, who is seated beside him. Ernest Griset's print of 1869 brings the satire up to date by picturing a crowd of pedants equipped with telescopes, measuring instruments and a primitive camera, all focussed into the distance on the minuscule mouse on the peak. An 1880 grisaille by Louis Eugène Lambert (1825-1909) unites Horace’s interpretation of turbulence within the mountain as volcanic activity with the fable’s association with literary criticism. There a mouse crouches on the cover of an ancient book and looks across to an eruption. Edward Julius Detmold, on the other hand, reverses the scale in his Aesop’s Fables (1909) by picturing a huge mouse crouched upon a mountain outcrop.The fable was also annexed to the satirical work of political cartoonists. The agitation that greeted the British Roman Catholic Relief Act in 1829 was satirised in a contemporary print by Thomas McLean (1788-1875) with the title “The Mountain in Labour – or much ado about nothing”. In the United States several presidential nominees were made the butt of such cartoons, as were attempts to quell the disturbances preceding the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. In France the fable’s title was applied to the parliamentary policy of Louis Philippe and to the foreign policy of Napoleon III.


=== Music ===
During the 18th century, Jean-Philippe Valette (d.1750) compiled a collection of moralising fables based on La Fontaine’s and set to popular tunes of the day, Recueil de fables choisies dans le goût de La Fontaine, sur de petits airs et vaudevilles connus (1734). Among these was ""The Mountain in Labour"" (La montagne en travail), retold in three regular quatrains. This version was set to the air Nos plaisirs seront peu durable and provided with the moral Grand bruit, peu d'effet, the French equivalent of the English proverb ""A great cry and little wool"". There was also a new edition of La Vallette’s work published in 1886 with a piano arrangement by Léopold Dauphin (1847 - 1925). The fable’s text was also set by Emmanuel Clerc (b. 1963) as part of his work Fables (2013).The words of La Fontaine's own fable were set by several other musicians, including:

Jules Moinaux in 1846.
Théodore Ymbert for two voices (1860).
Pauline Thys as part of her Six Fables de La Fontaine (1861).
Félix Godefroid for four unaccompanied men’s voices (1861).
Régis Campo as the second of his 5 Fables de La Fontaine (2005).
Alain Savouret (b. 1942) in a setting for accompanied voice (2013).In addition there was an English-language version set by Bob Chilcott as the fourth in his Aesop's Fables for piano and choir (2008); and a purely musical interpretation for small orchestra by Matt Fernald as the first part of his musical thesis composition, performed under the title An Evening with Aesop in 2013.

The story became proverbial in Classical times and was applied to a variety of situations. It refers to speech acts which promise much but deliver little, especially in literary and political contexts. In more modern times the satirical intention behind the fable was given greater emphasis following Jean de la Fontaine's interpretation of it. Illustrations to the text underlined its ironical application particularly and went on to influence cartoons referring to the fable elsewhere in Europe and America.

Phaedrus then went on to say that this applies to those who make serious but empty threats. 
But the most well-known mention of the fable appears in Horace's epistle on <i>The Art of Poetry</i>. Discussing what to avoid in a poem's opening, he recommends

== The Mouse-Maid Made Mouse ==
The story found in the Panchatantra relates how a mouse drops from the beak of a bird of prey into the hands of a holy man, who turns it into a girl and brings her up as his own. Eventually he seeks a powerful marriage for her but discovers at each application that there is one more powerful:  thus the cloud can cover the sun, the wind blows the clouds about but is resisted by the mountain; the mountain, however, is penetrated by mice. Since the girl feels the call of like to like in this case, she is changed back to her original form and goes to live with her husband in his hole. A variant of the tale appears among the Folk-Tales of Bengal under the name ""The Origin of Opium"". There, a holy man grants a mouse's successive wishes to become more than itself until it is changed into a woman fair enough to catch a king's eye. When she dies soon after in an accident, a mood-changing opium plant grows from her burial place.
The ancient Indian fable was eventually translated into Pahlavi and then into Arabic, but before a version of any of these works had reached Europe the fable appeared in Marie de France's Ysopet as a cautionary tale against social climbing through marrying above one's station. The creature involved is an ambitious field mouse who applies to the sun for the hand of his daughter. He is sent on to a cloud, the wind, a tower, and then the mouse that undermines it, to the humbling of his aspirations.The theme of keeping to one's class reappears in a Romanian folk variant in which a rat sets out to pay God a visit. He applies to the sun and to clouds for directions, but neither will answer such a creature; then he asks the wind, which picks him up and flings him on an ant-heap - 'and there he found his level', the story concludes. A less harsh judgement is exhibited in Japanese and Korean variants where the father seeking a powerful match for his daughter is sent round the traditional characters of sun, cloud and wind, only to discover that he too has his place on the ladder of power. All these are animal fables that lack the transformation theme. In the Japanese case a rat is involved and in the Korean a mole.The later version in La Fontaine's Fables, ""The Mouse Metamorphosed into a Maid"" (IX.7), acknowledges the story's Indian origin by making it a Brahmin who fosters the mouse and gives it back the body it had in a former birth. La Fontaine feigns shock at all this and finds at the story's culmination, in which the girl falls in love with the burrowing rat at the mere mention of its name, an argument to confound the Eastern fabulist's beliefs:

In all respects, compared and weigh'd,
The souls of men and souls of mice
Quite different are made -
Unlike in sort as well as size.
Each fits and fills its destined part
As Heaven doth well provide;
Nor witch, nor fiend, nor magic art,
Can set their laws aside.The fable’s philosophical theme inspired the American poet Marianne Moore to a wry  and idiosyncratic recreation in her version of La Fontaine (1954):

We are what we were at birth, and each trait has remained
in conformity with earth's and with heaven's logic:
Be the devil's tool, resort to black magic,
None can diverge from the ends which Heaven foreordained.This in turn was set for unaccompanied soprano by the British composer Alexander Goehr in 1993 (Opus 54). The fable was also the subject of Print 90 in Marc Chagall's set of 100 etchings of La Fontaine's work executed between 1927 and 1930.


== Venus and the Cat ==
 
The Indian fable's western equivalent is the story of ""Venus (or Aphrodite) and the Cat"", which goes back to Classical times and is given the moral that nature is stronger than nurture. It figures as number 50 in the Perry Index and its many versions feature a cat turned into a woman by the goddess, who then tests her on the wedding night by introducing a mouse into the bedchamber. In the Greek version by Babrius, however, it is a weasel (γαλῆ) that falls in love with a man and begs Aphrodite to change her into a human, but then goes chasing after a mouse in the middle of the marriage feast. In ancient times it was speculated that the Greek proverb ‘a saffron (wedding) robe does not suit a weasel’ was connected with the fable and has much the same meaning that one’s underlying nature does not change with circumstances.When the fable was related by Hieronymus Osius in a New Latin poem, nearly half of it was taken up by a consideration of basic unchangeability, the sense being echoed by internal rhyme and assonance: ""Difficult to elicit, illicit,/ change where nature’s innate"". During the troubled political situation at the time the edition of Aesop's fables illustrated by Francis Barlow was published, Aphra Behn gave a sly Royalist tilt to her summing up of the tale’s meaning: ""Ill principles no mercy can reclaime,/ And once a Rebell still will be the same"". In both these versions a young man besotted with his pet cat prays to the goddess to make the change so that they can marry.  The fable in the Barlow volume also has two different titles. On the illustration appears the English ""The young man and his cat"", while in the Latin explanatory text it reads De Cata in Fœminam mutate (The cat changed into a woman).
Jean de la Fontaine wrote a separate version of this fable, also under the title ""The cat changed into a woman"" (La chatte metamorphosée en femme, II.18), in which he gave the theme of change an extended, thoughtful treatment:

So great is stubborn nature's force.
In mockery of change, the old
Will keep their youthful bent.
When once the cloth has got its fold,
The smelling-pot its scent,
In vain your efforts and your care
To make them other than they are.
To work reform, do what you will,
Old habit will be habit still.Though La Fontaine avoided mention of Venus as the intermediary for the change in his fable, she is there in Christopher Pitt's ""The Fable of the Young Man and his Cat"", which is turned into a satirical picture of womanhood. Except in the one important respect, the transformed cat accorded to the 18th-century social norm and

From a grave thinking Mouser, she was grown
The gayest Flirt that coach'd it round the Town.Her reversion to cathood is interpreted by Pitt as a return to innate femininity; the foolish 
man is jilted by her, rather than she being punished by the goddess.


== Artistic versions ==

La Fontaine's fable also received musical treatments which reinterpreted the basic story. Jacques Offenbach's one-act operetta La Chatte Metamorphosée en Femme (1858) verges on farce. A financially ruined reclusive bachelor is pursued by his female cousin. With the help of a Hindu fakir, she makes him believe that she is the reincarnation of the pet cat with which he is besotted. Its happy ending is reversed in Henri Sauguet's popular ballet La Chatte (1927). Here the goddess Aphrodite turns the woman back into a cat again after she leaves her lover to chase a mouse and he dies of disappointment. There had in fact been a much earlier ballet of La chatte metamorphosée en femme, with music by Alexandre Montfort and choreography by Jean Coralli. This was first performed in 1837 with the Austrian dancer Fanny Elssler in the lead role. Not only did the work inspire Offenbach to write his opera but it was also indirectly responsible for Frederick Ashton's late ballet of that name, created in 1985 for a gala in honour of Fanny Elssler in Vienna. Then in 1999 the French composer Isabelle Aboulker set La Fontaine's fable for piano and soprano as one of the four in her Femmes en fables.

Interpretations in the Fine Arts include Millet's chalk and pastel drawing of the fable (c.1858) in which a black cat with shining eyes enters and looks toward a startled man who pokes his head through the bed curtains (see opposite). This was followed by an Art Nouveau marble sculpture exhibited in 1908 by Ferdinand Faivre in which the woman seems more to be contemplating and stroking the mouse than hunting it. Later the subject featured as Plate 25 in Marc Chagall's etchings of La Fontaine's fables in which a figure with the head of a cat but the well-developed body of a woman looks out from the picture while leaning on a small table. Four centuries earlier Wenceslas Hollar had also pictured the transformation scene half way through in his illustration for John Ogilby’s The Fables of Aesop (1668).
Chagall's print, in its turn, inspired a poem by American poet Patricia Fargnoli. Published in her collection Small Songs of Pain (2003), it considers what the physical process of changing into a woman must have felt like. With its concentration on the woman's sexual characteristics, it takes us full circle to François Chauveau’s copper engraving in the first edition of La Fontaine's Fables (1668), which suggests that the hunt for the mouse takes place immediately following the act of love. This underlines the character of Aphrodite's test of the woman and explains the love-goddess' judgement in turning her back to her original form.

<dd>None can diverge from the ends which Heaven foreordained.</dd></dl></dd></dl><p>This in turn was set for unaccompanied soprano by the British composer Alexander Goehr in 1993 (Opus 54). The fable was also the subject of Print 90 in Marc Chagall's set of 100 etchings of La Fontaine's work executed between 1927 and 1930.</p>
<h2><span id=""Venus_and_the_Cat"">Venus and the Cat</span></h2>
 
<p>The Indian fable's western equivalent is the story of ""Venus (or Aphrodite) and the Cat"", which goes back to Classical times and is given the moral that nature is stronger than nurture. It figures as number 50 in the Perry Index and its many versions feature a cat turned into a woman by the goddess, who then tests her on the wedding night by introducing a mouse into the bedchamber. In the Greek version by Babrius, however, it is a weasel (γαλῆ) that falls in love with a man and begs Aphrodite to change her into a human, but then goes chasing after a mouse in the middle of the marriage feast. In ancient times it was speculated that the Greek proverb ‘a saffron (wedding) robe does not suit a weasel’ was connected with the fable and has much the same meaning that one’s underlying nature does not change with circumstances.</p><p>When the fable was related by Hieronymus Osius in a New Latin poem, nearly half of it was taken up by a consideration of basic unchangeability, the sense being echoed by internal rhyme and assonance: ""Difficult to elicit, illicit,/ change where nature’s innate"". During the troubled political situation at the time the edition of Aesop's fables illustrated by Francis Barlow was published, Aphra Behn gave a sly Royalist tilt to her summing up of the tale’s meaning: ""Ill principles no mercy can reclaime,/ And once a Rebell still will be the same"". In both these versions a young man besotted with his pet cat prays to the goddess to make the change so that they can marry.  The fable in the Barlow volume also has two different titles. On the illustration appears the English ""The young man and his cat"", while in the Latin explanatory text it reads <i>De Cata in Fœminam mutate</i> (The cat changed into a woman).
</p><p>Jean de la Fontaine wrote a separate version of this fable, also under the title ""The cat changed into a woman"" (<i>La chatte metamorphosée en femme</i>, II.18), in which he gave the theme of change an extended, thoughtful treatment:
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>So great is stubborn nature's force.</dd>
<dd>In mockery of change, the old</dd>
<dd>Will keep their youthful bent.</dd>
<dd>When once the cloth has got its fold,</dd>
<dd>The smelling-pot its scent,</dd>
<dd>In vain your efforts and your care</dd>
<dd>To make them other than they are.</dd>
<dd>To work reform, do what you will,</dd>
<dd>Old habit will be habit still.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>Though La Fontaine avoided mention of Venus as the intermediary for the change in his fable, she is there in Christopher Pitt's ""The Fable of the Young Man and his Cat"", which is turned into a satirical picture of womanhood. Except in the one important respect, the transformed cat accorded to the 18th-century social norm and
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>From a grave thinking Mouser, she was grown</dd>
<dd>The gayest Flirt that coach'd it round the Town.</dd></dl></dd></dl><p>Her reversion to cathood is interpreted by Pitt as a return to innate femininity; the foolish 
man is jilted by her, rather than she being punished by the goddess.</p>
<h2><span id=""Artistic_versions"">Artistic versions</span></h2>

<p>La Fontaine's fable also received musical treatments which reinterpreted the basic story. Jacques Offenbach's one-act operetta <i>La Chatte Metamorphosée en Femme</i> (1858) verges on farce. A financially ruined reclusive bachelor is pursued by his female cousin. With the help of a Hindu fakir, she makes him believe that she is the reincarnation of the pet cat with which he is besotted. Its happy ending is reversed in Henri Sauguet's popular ballet <i>La Chatte</i> (1927). Here the goddess Aphrodite turns the woman back into a cat again after she leaves her lover to chase a mouse and he dies of disappointment. There had in fact been a much earlier ballet of <i>La chatte metamorphosée en femme</i>, with music by Alexandre Montfort and choreography by Jean Coralli. This was first performed in 1837 with the Austrian dancer Fanny Elssler in the lead role. Not only did the work inspire Offenbach to write his opera but it was also indirectly responsible for Frederick Ashton's late ballet of that name, created in 1985 for a gala in honour of Fanny Elssler in Vienna. Then in 1999 the French composer Isabelle Aboulker set La Fontaine's fable for piano and soprano as one of the four in her <i>Femmes en fables</i>.</p>

<p>Interpretations in the Fine Arts include Millet's chalk and pastel drawing of the fable (c.1858) in which a black cat with shining eyes enters and looks toward a startled man who pokes his head through the bed curtains (see opposite). This was followed by an Art Nouveau marble sculpture exhibited in 1908 by Ferdinand Faivre in which the woman seems more to be contemplating and stroking the mouse than hunting it. Later the subject featured as Plate 25 in Marc Chagall's etchings of La Fontaine's fables in which a figure with the head of a cat but the well-developed body of a woman looks out from the picture while leaning on a small table. Four centuries earlier Wenceslas Hollar had also pictured the transformation scene half way through in his illustration for John Ogilby’s The Fables of Aesop (1668).
</p><p>Chagall's print, in its turn, inspired a poem by American poet Patricia Fargnoli. Published in her collection <i>Small Songs of Pain</i> (2003), it considers what the physical process of changing into a woman must have felt like. With its concentration on the woman's sexual characteristics, it takes us full circle to François Chauveau’s copper engraving in the first edition of La Fontaine's <i>Fables</i> (1668), which suggests that the hunt for the mouse takes place immediately following the act of love. This underlines the character of Aphrodite's test of the woman and explains the love-goddess' judgement in turning her back to her original form.

== Versions ==
Greek versions of this fable are told of the raven (κοραξ) while it is called a kite (milvus) in Mediaeval Latin sources. The bird is ill and asks its grieving mother to pray in the temples on its behalf. The mother replies that since it was a robber of the sacrifices there, religious observance would now be of no use. The fable appears in the collection of William Caxton and in many others, generally with a reflection on the uselessness of death-bed repentance.
In the 1546 edition of the Emblemata by Andrea Alciato the story is modified. There the bird vomits and is told by its parent that it is losing nothing of its own, since all it has eaten was stolen. The fable is used to illustrate the Latin proverb male parta, male dilabuntur (ill-gotten, ill-spent). A sceptical variation on the theme directed against religious observance later appeared in Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's collection of prose fables (1759). 'The fox, observing that the raven plundered the altars of the gods, and that he supported himself from their sacrifices, said to himself: I should like to know whether the raven partakes of their sacrifices because he is a prophetical bird; or whether he is deemed a prophetical bird because he is so insolent as to partake of the sacrifices?'

== The Fable ==
There is a short Greek version of the fable and a longer, more circumstantial late Latin poem by Avianus. It concerns two pots, one of earthenware and the other of metal, that are being swept along a river. While the metal pot is willing that they should journey together, the clay pot hopes it will keep its distance for ‘Whether the wave crashes me into you or you into me, in either case I will be the only victim’. The moral drawn is that equal partnership is best, and especially that the poor or powerless should avoid the company of the powerful.
In this connection, there is a likeness between the story and a passage in the debated book of Ecclesiasticus that advises caution in such unequal relationships: 'Have no fellowship with one that is richer than thyself. What agreement shall the earthen pot have with the kettle? For if they knock one against the other, it shall be broken' (13.2-3). Since this particular scripture is in Greek and dates from the 2nd century BCE, it is possible that the passage quoted and the fable are both based on a popular proverb. But there is also a connection with a later Talmudic proverb which underlines the no-win situation of the fable: 'If a pot falls upon a stone, woe to the pot; if a stone falls upon a pot, woe to the pot; either way, woe to the pot' (Esther Rabbah, 7:10).

Yet another oriental connection with this proverbial lore occurs in the Indian Panchatantra. In its second section, which deals with the gaining of friends, there is a long debate between Hiranyaka the rat and Laghupatanaka the crow about partnership between such natural enemies as themselves. One of the points made is that 'Friendship with bad men is like a pot of clay, easy to break but difficult to rejoin. With good men it is like a pot of gold, difficult to break but easy to mend.' Here once again we find earthenware and metal pots contrasted.
The connection with the passage in Ecclesiasticus was noted by Andrea Alciato in the various editions of his Emblemata. The aim of his collection was to point a moral lesson through an iconic illustration, supported by Latin verses (and translations into other languages) and a commentary. The fable of the two pots was chosen to illustrate the Latin proverb Aliquid mali propter vicinum malum (Bad comes of a bad neighbour), which Erasmus had included in his Adagia (Adage 32). The English poet Geoffrey Whitney followed Alciato in all this, using an illustration from one of his editions in his Choice of Emblemes (1568), but supporting it with an 18-line poem of his own. The final stanza sums up the meaning of the fable:

The running streame, this worldlie sea dothe shewe;
The pottes present the mightie, and the pore:
Whoe here, a time are tosséd too and froe,
But if the meane dwell nighe the mighties dore,
He maie be hurte, but cannot hurte againe,
Then like, to like: or beste alone remaine.While the title of Aesop's fable is almost always given as ""The Two Pots"", La Fontaine's Fables contrast their different constituents in a rather different fable based on it, Le pot de terre et le pot de fer (Fables V.2). In this the iron pot proposes a journey together to the clay pot, which is only persuaded by the stronger pot's offer to protect him. When they are jostled together on their way, the clay pot is shattered and only has himself to blame. 'Only equals should associate' is the conclusion. A French proverb  derives from this fable, where the phrase 'It's the iron pot against the clay pot' (C'est le pot de fer contre le pot de terre) is used in cases when the weak come off worst. In 1713 Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, was to use La Fontaine's version of the story in her lively recreation, ""The Brass-Pot and Stone-Jugg"".


== Artistic interpretations ==
Book illustrations of Aesop's fable inevitably picture two contrasting pots being carried along a river. In the lively woodblock print by the Japanese artist Kawanabe Kyosai, the pots are given human forms and shown tossed on the waves of a heavy sea. There the earthen pot is desperately fending off the friendly approach of the metal pot. In the distance is a town with mountains behind it. How much Kyosai has added is plain when one compares his version with the one by John Tenniel on which it is based. The gated town in the background is almost identical, but Tenniel shows the two pots becalmed in an eddy near the mouth of an estuary. This in turn looks back to the various illustrations in Alciato's Book of Emblems, especially that of the 1591 edition. There the pots are tossed on waves as they are carried towards the sea; in the background are mountains with a town at their foot and a castle perched on a height.Two French composers have set La Fontaine's fable. Isabelle Aboulker among Les Fables enchantées (1979) and Dominique Preschez (1954-) as the second of her Trois fables en une (1995).

== A fable of ingratitude ==
There are two related Greek versions of the fable. Illustrating the ingratitude of those who requite good deeds with cruelty, it concerns a walnut tree (καρυα) standing by the roadside whose nuts the passersby used to knock off by throwing sticks and stones. It then complained, 'People gladly enjoy my fruits, but they have a terrible way of showing their gratitude.' Its complaint is related to a debate on gratitude that occurs in a parallel Indian story from the Panchatantra. There a mango tree is asked whether it is lawful to return evil for good and replies that its experience of man is violent treatment despite providing him with fruit and shade. On the other hand, the 18th century German rationalist, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, questioned whether there are real grounds for gratitude in his fable of ""The Oak Tree and the Swine"". The pig feeding at the foot of an oak is reproached for its motives of pure greed by the tree and replies that it would only feel grateful if it could be sure that the oak had scattered the acorns there out of love for it.

The Greek fable was later the subject of an epigram by Antipater of Thessalonica:

They planted me, a walnut-tree, by the road-side
to amuse passing boys, as a mark for their well-aimed stones.
All my twigs and flourishing shoots are broken,
hit as I am by showers of pebbles.
It is no advantage for trees to be fruitful; I, indeed,
bore fruit only for my own undoing.This in turn gave rise to Latin versions, in one of which the tree is represented as being pelted with rods. There was also a much longer poem, at one time ascribed to Ovid but now thought to be an imitation, in which the nut tree complains at length of the violent way in which it is despoiled. In this more leisurely work of 182 lines, as well as Aesop's fable of the nut tree being the subject, there is a glance at another concerning The Travellers and the Plane Tree. While the fruit tree is treated with no respect, ‘barren plane trees have more honour for the shade they provide’ (at postquam platanis sterilem praebentibus umbram uberior quavis arbore venit honor).
In Renaissance times the fable was taken up by the compilers of emblem books, starting with the originator of this genre, Andrea Alciato. Eventually numbered 193 in the many editions of his Emblemata, it bore the device In fertilitatem sibi ipsi damnosam (fruitful to its own ruin), deriving from the last line of the original epigram by Antipater. Many of the illustrations accompanying this feature boys stoning the tree and gathering its fruit from the ground. In others, however, youths are shown with substantial sticks in their hands, as in the illustration here, and so suggest the folk belief that beating it made the tree more fruitful.


== The proverb of a woman, an ass and a walnut tree ==
A few decades before Alciato first published his emblem, Aesop's fable had served as basis for an independent version by Laurentius Abstemius in his Hecatomythium, published in the 1490s. Numbered 65, De nuce, asino et muliere describes how a woman asked the abused tree 'why it was so foolish as to give more and better nuts when struck by more and stronger blows? The tree replied: Have you forgotten about the proverb that goes: Nut tree, donkey and woman are bound by a similar law; these three things do nothing right if you stop beating them.' The moral that Abstemius draws from it is that people talk too much for their own good. 
The Italian proverb based on this lore was perpetuated in Britain for the next two centuries. George Pettie's translation of the Civil Conversations of Stefano Guazzo (1530–93), a book first published in Italy in 1574, records that he had once come across the proverb 'A woman, an ass and a walnut tree, Bring more fruit, the more beaten they be'. What is now the better known English version appears shortly after in the works of John Taylor, 

A woman, a spaniel and a walnut tree,
The more they're beaten the better still they be.Roger L'Estrange includes Abstemius' story in his Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists a century later. His shortened version runs: 'A Good Woman happen'd to pass by, as a Company of Young Fellows were Cudgelling a Wallnut-Tree, and ask'd them what they did that for? This is only by the Way of Discipline, says one of the Lads, for 'tis natural for Asses, Women, and Wallnut-Trees to Mend upon Beating.' L'Estrange's idiomatic comment, 'Spur a Jade a Question, and he'll Kick ye an Answer,' indicates his opinion of the sentiment. People's conversation will betray their true quality. Edmund Arwaker, on the other hand, gives the story another twist in his versified telling of the fables, Truth in Fiction (London, 1708). The talkative woman questions the tree in the course of a solitary walk and it replies in this way in order to silence her.Whatever may have been people's opinion of how well a woman, ass or dog respond to punishment, the belief that this was beneficial in the case of walnut trees persisted. One encyclopaedia of superstions reports that in country districts 'it was a common persuasion that whipping a walnut tree tended to increase the produce and improve the quality of the fruit’ and that this took place in early spring. Another explanation is that 'the old custom of beating a walnut-tree was carried out firstly to fetch down the fruit and secondly to break the long shoots and so encourage the production of short fruiting spurs.’

</p>
<dl><dd>They planted me, a walnut-tree, by the road-side</dd>
<dd>to amuse passing boys, as a mark for their well-aimed stones.</dd>
<dd>All my twigs and flourishing shoots are broken,</dd>
<dd>hit as I am by showers of pebbles.</dd>
<dd>It is no advantage for trees to be fruitful; I, indeed,</dd>
<dd>bore fruit only for my own undoing.</dd></dl><p>This in turn gave rise to Latin versions, in one of which the tree is represented as being pelted with rods. There was also a much longer poem, at one time ascribed to Ovid but now thought to be an imitation, in which the nut tree complains at length of the violent way in which it is despoiled. In this more leisurely work of 182 lines, as well as Aesop's fable of the nut tree being the subject, there is a glance at another concerning The Travellers and the Plane Tree. While the fruit tree is treated with no respect, ‘barren plane trees have more honour for the shade they provide’ (<i>at postquam platanis sterilem praebentibus umbram uberior quavis arbore venit honor</i>).
</p><p>In Renaissance times the fable was taken up by the compilers of emblem books, starting with the originator of this genre, Andrea Alciato. Eventually numbered 193 in the many editions of his <i>Emblemata</i>, it bore the device <i>In fertilitatem sibi ipsi damnosam</i> (fruitful to its own ruin), deriving from the last line of the original epigram by Antipater. Many of the illustrations accompanying this feature boys stoning the tree and gathering its fruit from the ground. In others, however, youths are shown with substantial sticks in their hands, as in the illustration here, and so suggest the folk belief that beating it made the tree more fruitful.

<p>A few decades before Alciato first published his emblem, Aesop's fable had served as basis for an independent version by Laurentius Abstemius in his <i>Hecatomythium</i>, published in the 1490s. Numbered 65, <i>De nuce, asino et muliere</i> describes how a woman asked the abused tree 'why it was so foolish as to give more and better nuts when struck by more and stronger blows? The tree replied: Have you forgotten about the proverb that goes: Nut tree, donkey and woman are bound by a similar law; these three things do nothing right if you stop beating them.' The moral that Abstemius draws from it is that people talk too much for their own good. 
</p><p>The Italian proverb based on this lore was perpetuated in Britain for the next two centuries. George Pettie's translation of the <i>Civil Conversations</i> of Stefano Guazzo (1530–93), a book first published in Italy in 1574, records that he had once come across the proverb 'A woman, an ass and a walnut tree, Bring more fruit, the more beaten they be'. What is now the better known English version appears shortly after in the works of John Taylor, 
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>A woman, a spaniel and a walnut tree,</dd>
<dd>The more they're beaten the better still they be.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>Roger L'Estrange includes Abstemius' story in his <i>Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists</i> a century later. His shortened version runs: 'A Good Woman happen'd to pass by, as a Company of Young Fellows were Cudgelling a Wallnut-Tree, and ask'd them what they did that for? This is only by the Way of Discipline, says one of the Lads, for 'tis natural for Asses, Women, and Wallnut-Trees to Mend upon Beating.' L'Estrange's idiomatic comment, 'Spur a Jade a Question, and he'll Kick ye an Answer,' indicates his opinion of the sentiment. People's conversation will betray their true quality. Edmund Arwaker, on the other hand, gives the story another twist in his versified telling of the fables, <i>Truth in Fiction</i> (London, 1708). The talkative woman questions the tree in the course of a solitary walk and it replies in this way in order to silence her.</p><p>Whatever may have been people's opinion of how well a woman, ass or dog respond to punishment, the belief that this was beneficial in the case of walnut trees persisted. One encyclopaedia of superstions reports that in country districts 'it was a common persuasion that whipping a walnut tree tended to increase the produce and improve the quality of the fruit’ and that this took place in early spring. Another explanation is that 'the old custom of beating a walnut-tree was carried out firstly to fetch down the fruit and secondly to break the long shoots and so encourage the production of short fruiting spurs.’</p>

== Creation ==

In 1665, André Le Nôtre planned a hedge maze of unadorned paths in an area south of the Latona Fountain near the Orangerie. In 1668 Jean de La Fontaine published his first collection Fables Choisies, dedicated to ""Monseigneur"" Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the six-year-old son of Louis XIV. Although La Fontaine had incurred the royal displeasure, his poems  perhaps encouraged Charles Perrault, author of the Mother Goose stories, who the year before had been named senior civil servant in the Superintendence of the King's Buildings, to advise Louis XIV in 1669 to remodel the labyrinth in such a way as to serve the Dauphin’s education. Between 1672 and 1677 Le Nôtre redesigned the labyrinth to feature thirty-nine fountains that depicted stories from Aesop’s Fables.  The sculptors Jean-Baptiste Tuby, Etienne Le Hongre, Pierre Le Gros, and the brothers Gaspard and Balthazard Marsy worked on these thirty-nine hydraulic sculptures.
Each fountain was accompanied by a plaque on which the fable was printed, with verse written by Isaac de Benserade. It was from these plaques, Louis XIV’s son learned to read. In his Fables d'Ésope en quatrains, dont il y en a une partie au labyrinthe de Versailles de Benserade claims that, as well being the one to choose the fables, it was the King himself who had wanted a quatrain to describe each of them.Once completed in 1677 the labyrinth contained thirty-nine fountains with 333 painted metal animal sculptures. The water for the elaborate waterworks was conveyed from the Seine by the Machine de Marly, which used fourteen water-wheels driving 253 pumps, some of which worked at a distance of three-quarters of a mile.The layout of the maze was unusual, as there was no central goal, and, despite the five-metre-high (16 ft) hedges, allowed glimpses ahead. Jean-Aymar Piganiol de La Force in his Nouvelle description du château et parc de Versailles et de Marly (1702) describes the labyrinth as a ""network of allées bordered with palisades where it is easy to get lost."" He continues: ""At every turn you see a fountain decorated with delicate rocaille, and representing very simply a fable, the subject of which is indicated by a four-line inscription in gold letters on a bronze plate.""Shortly after the labyrinth was completed, Perrault published a description in his Recueil de divers ouvrages en prose et en vers. ""At each end of a path,"" he wrote, ""and wherever they cross, there are fountains, so arranged that in whatever place one finds oneself, one sees always three or four and often six or seven of them at once. The basins of these fountains, all different in figure and design, are enriched with fine rock-work and rare shells and for ornamentation have different animals who represent the most charming fables of Aesop. These animals are so well made and lifelike that they seem to be still in the action that they depict; one can even say that they in some way speak the words that the fable attributes to them, since the water that they spout forth at one another seems not only to give them life and action, but serves them also as a voice to express their passions and their thoughts."" 


== Success ==

This labyrinth was so popular, not only with the King and the young Dauphin, but with the nobility and gentry who were allowed to visit the garden, that a guidebook was published, Perrault's Labyrinte de Versailles, which contained the fables, a description of the fountains and the quatrains written by the poet Isaac Benserade for each fable. It was first published in 1675, then reprinted in 1677 with engravings by Sébastien Leclerc. A third version, in which the engravings by Leclerc were illuminated by Jacques Bailly was produced soon after.
The small, pocket-sized books were richly bound in red Morocco leather with stamped gilt decoration. The book was eventually translated into English, appearing twice in 1768, in John Bowles's edition and Daniel Bellamy senior's Aesop at Court, with plates engraved by George Bickham.The labyrinth contributed greatly to the wonder that the Gardens of Versailles instilled in visitors and diplomats from abroad. An illustrated guide printed in Amsterdam in 1682 praised Le Nôtre's work saying, ""Amongst all these works there is nothing more admirable and praiseworthy than the Royal Garden at Versailles, and, in it, the Labyrinth... The Turnings and Windings, edged on both sides with green cropt hedges, are not at all tedious, by reason that at every hand there are figures and water-works representing the mysterious and instructive fables of Aesop"".The composer Marin Marais, hired in 1676 as a musician to the royal court of Versailles, knew the labyrinth. He wrote in the avertissements  to his The Labyrinth and other stories, ""One enters the labyrinth and, after descending to the ducks and dog comes up again next to Bacchus.""  He also knew that nearby the labyrinth there was another bosquet called the Ballroom, which could explain the chaconne which brings his long, mysterious Labyrinthe to a close. Titon du Tillet admired it: ""The piece from his Fourth Book, titled Le Labyrinthe, in which after roaming through various keys, touching diverse dissonances, and underlining, first with sombre tones and later with lively and sprightly ones, the uncertainty of a man lost in a labyrinth, the composer manages happily to find the way out at last and finishes with a graceful and natural sounding Chaconne.""


== Aesop and Love ==

Two statues were placed at the entrance to the labyrinth (""A"" in the plan), one of Aesop by Le Gros (""B"") holding a scroll of paper and the other of Love or Cupid by Tuby (""C"") holding a ball of thread, like Ariadne's.Perrault writes of the two figures: ""Aesop has a roll of paper which he shows to Love who has a ball of thread, as if to say that if God has committed men to troublesome labyrinths, there is no secret to getting out as long as Love is accompanied by wisdom, of which Aesop in his fables teaches the path.""For Michel Conan, the maze's design ""invited all visitors to give first-person attention"" to their movements, and the statues ""advised that unless they pondered their choices they might fail to find their way through the labyrinth."" For him, the labyrinth, as a metaphor for life, ""encouraged self-reflection and a search for a personal code of conduct"", with the dialogue between Cupid and Aesop at the entrance emphasising this:
Cupid: Yes, I can now close my eyes and laugh: with this thread I'll find my way.Aesop:Love, that slender thread might get you lost: the slightest shock could break it.

== Destruction ==
Citing repair and maintenance costs, Louis XVI ordered the labyrinth destroyed in 1778.  In its place, an arboretum of exotic trees was planted as an English-styled garden.  Rechristened Bosquet de la Reine, it would be in this part of the garden that an episode of the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, which compromised Marie-Antoinette, transpired in 1785.
In the reserve collections of the Musée national des châteaux de Versailles et de Trianon, there remain only thirty-four fragments of the fountains, as well as the statues of L'Amour and Aesop.

== The fables of Marie de France ==

The origin of the term 'Ysopet' dates back to the twelfth century, where it was first used by Marie de France, whose collection of 102 fables, written in Anglo-Norman octosyllabic couplets, she claims to have translated from an original work by Alfred the Great. Since there is no evidence of any such Old English material, this has been disputed.The fables come from a variety of sources and feature not simply animals (and insects) but human beings as well. The first forty correspond to one of the Romulus collections of Aesop but even here there are variations. The story she calls ""The Dog and the Cheese"" differs from Classical versions of The Dog and its Reflection precisely in the detail that it is cheese rather than a bone or piece of meat that it is carrying. Many other stories make their first appearance in the Ysopet, particularly those featuring human beings. One at least, The Mouse Takes a Wife, only appears for the first time in the West but has earlier eastern analogues. Others still fit into well established categories of folk tale and suggest an oral transmission.


== The morals ==
It is in drawing moral conclusions from the behaviour of the characters involved that Marie is at her most individual, reflecting the realities of 12th century feudal society at the same time as concern for the individual welfare of those within it. While she accepts its stratification, her criticism of those who abuse their position is sharp and her sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden is obvious. In particular she criticizes the inequalities of the legal system (The Wolf and the Lamb, The Dog and the Sheep), injudicious choice of deputy and betrayal of faith.
Marie's portrayal of women in particular is two-edged and not always consistent. In the tale of The Wife and her Husband, where a resourceful wife persuades the husband that he has not really seen her in bed with another man, Marie remarks that 'good sense and imagination are more valuable and useful to many people than their money or their family'. But in the similar situation of The Wife and Her Husband in the Forest she concludes that 'for this reason women are criticized for their deceptiveness: these lying tricksters have more art than the devil.' The humorous ending of the otherwise horrifying story of The Man and the Wife Who Quarreled, in which a husband cuts out the tongue of his wife only to have her continue their quarrel in sign language, draws from Marie the wry comment that 'This fable shows what one can often see: if a fool talks foolishness and someone else comes along and speaks sense to him, he won't believe it but gets angry instead. Even when he knows he is absolutely in the wrong, he wants to have the last say, and no one can make him shut up.' The change of gender at the end indicates that for Marie, as for Jean de la Fontaine five centuries later, 'Many men are women too' (Fables VI.6). Her main concern is not gender politics but, as throughout the Ysopet, the wise, foolish or vicious use of the tongue.

== The Phaedrus version ==
 The early Latin version of Phaedrus begins with the reflection that ""Partnership with the mighty is never trustworthy"". It then relates how a cow, a goat and a sheep go hunting together with a lion. When it comes to dividing the spoil, the lion says, ""I take the first portion because of my title, since I am addressed as king; the second portion you will assign to me, since I’m your partner; then because I am the stronger, the third will follow me; and an accident will happen to anyone who touches the fourth."" This was listed as Fable 339 in the Perry Index and was later the version followed by William Caxton in his 1484 collection of the Fables.The number of differing variations circulating by the time of the Middle Ages is witnessed by the fact that Marie de France included two in her 12th century Ysopet. Both appear under the title ""The Lion Goes Hunting"" (De Leone Venante). On one occasion, she recounts, the lion is joined by officers of his court, a wild ox and a wolf, who divide the catch into three and invite their lord to apportion it. Then on another occasion, when the lion is accompanied by a goat and a sheep, the deer they take is divided into four. In both cases the lion begins by claiming portions as a legal right and retains the others with threats. In La Fontaine's Fables there is a fourfold division between a heifer, a goat and a lamb (Fables I.6). Each of these the lion retains because he is king, the strongest, the bravest, and will kill the first who touches the fourth part.A Latin reference to Aesop's fable is found at the start of the Common Era, where the phrase societas leonina (a leonine company) was used by one Roman lawyer to describe the kind of unequal business partnership described by Aesop. The early 19th century writer Jefferys Taylor also retold the fable in terms of a commercial enterprise in his poem ""The Beasts in Partnership"":

This firm once existed, I'd have you to know,
Messrs Lion, Wolf, Tiger, Fox, Leopard & Co;
These in business were join'd, and of course 'twas implied,
They their stocks should unite, and the profits divide.


== The Babrius version ==
In the extended Greek telling of Babrius it is a wild donkey and a lion who go hunting together, the first outstanding for strength, the second for speed. The lion divides their take into three, awarding himself the first because he is king of the beasts, the second because they are 'equal' partners, and suggesting that the ass runs away quickly rather than dare to touch the third. The moral Babrius draws is, ""Measure yourself! Do not engage in any business or partnership with a man more powerful!""Another version that first appeared in the Middle Ages is more cynical still. A fox joins the lion and donkey in hunting. When the donkey divides their catch into three equal portions, the angry lion kills the donkey and eats him. The fox then puts everything into one pile, leaving just a tiny bit for herself, and tells the lion to choose. When the lion asks her how she learned to share things this way, the fox replies, ""From the donkey’s misfortune."" This variation is given a separate number (149) in the Perry Index and is the one followed by such Neo-Latin writers as Gabriele Faerno and Hieronymus Osius and in English by Geoffrey Whitney.This alternative fable was given a different reading by the 13th century Persian poet, Rumi in his Masnavi. He began by orienting the reader to interpret the fable in a spiritual sense:

Melt away your existence, as copper in the elixir, in the being of Him who fosters existence.
You have fastened both your hands tight on 'I' and 'we': all this ruin is caused by dualism.In Rumi's telling, the lion had a wolf and a fox as hunting companions. The lion ordered the wolf to divide the catch and when it did so into three parts, tore off the wolf’s head, just as the lion tore the donkey to pieces in Aesop’s fable. Rumi's speciality, however, is always to offer an explanation of his actors' motives. In this case the lion explains that it is an act of grace for him to do so since the wolf did not recognise superiority when he saw it.
When the fox was tested in the same way, he did not even retain a morsel for himself, explaining (as in the Greek version) that he had learned wisdom from the wolf's fate and thanking the lion for giving him the privilege of going second. This allows Rumi to conclude that we are lucky to be living now, with the examples of past generations to guide us. Rumi’s fox then worships at the feet of the lion, addressing him with the words ""O king of the world"" and is duly rewarded for this devotion with everything that he had resigned to the divine king.
Much the same interpretation was given to the tale by Rumi's English contemporary, Odo of Cheriton, in the Latin work known as Parabolae. For him too the lion is a symbol of God and his actions are interpreted as an expression of divine justice. Odo explains that the lion punished the wolf, as God did Adam, for the sin of disobedience. The moral of the story is to learn from this example to show reverence to God, just as the fox learned from the wolf’s punishment. This reading of the fable therefore gained currency in Western Europe too, both via the preachers who used Odo's book as a source of stories for their sermons and through translations of it into French, Spanish and Welsh.


== Other related Eastern fables ==
There is a close family resemblance between fables where the lion takes all because he can and fables where an arbiter takes advantage of his powerful position, and indeed both are type 51 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system.  The 10th-century Arabic Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity tells one such arbitration fable, said there to be of Indian origin. Here a group of foxes are sharing a dead camel. They cannot decide how to divide it among themselves and persuade a passing wolf to make a just division. At first the wolf begins to do this, but on further consideration he decides to keep the rest for himself, as he is, after all, more powerful. (In this case, however, the foxes appeal to the lion who decides in their favour and kills the wolf and returns the camel to them.)
 
This fable shades into an Indian variant of the story, first told as the Dabbhapuppha Jataka, which features different animals but has at its centre the same situation of an animal making an unequal division. Here a jackal offers to arbitrate between two otters who are quarrelling over a fish they have co-operated in bringing to land. The jackal awards them the head and tail and runs off with the bulk of their catch. As well as being a condemnation of the greed that leads to strife, the tale takes a sceptical view of how the powerful frame the law to suit themselves, concluding with the satirical verse,

Just as, when strife arises among men,
They seek an arbiter: he's leader then;
Their wealth decays and the king's coffers gain.In that the tale deals with outside arbitration, however, it has certain points in common with another of Aesop's fables, The Lion, the Bear and the Fox, in which the first two beasts simultaneously attack a kid and then fight over their spoil. When they are both too exhausted to move, a fox steals their prey and leaves them to reflect, ""How much better it would have been to have shared in a friendly spirit.""

== Emblems and echoes ==
 
Although there is no known source for the story as such, it has been suggested that La Fontaine had in mind the French proverb la fortune vient en dormant (fortune comes while one sleeps), used of those who grow rich without exerting themselves.  A pictorial emblem was dedicated to this proposition in Guillaume Guéroult's Le premier livre des emblemes (1550), a book that is considered the source of several more of La Fontaine's fables. Emblem 16 has the title Fortune favorise sans labour (Fortune favours those who labour not) and points out in an opening verse that the blind and inconstant goddess disdains those who work hard in her pursuit. The illustration features a naked huntsman and a sleeping monarch.La Fontaine prefaces his fable with a meditation on the difficulties and uncertainties of chasing fortune and what motivates people to do so. As a notable example of success he does not mention an earthly monarch but, “‘That man,’ say they, and feed their hope,/ ‘Raised cabbages — and now he’s pope'"". Commentators cite several popes of humble origin, of whom the one that La Fontaine probably had in mind was the most recent, Sixtus V, once a swineherd in his youth. Charles Denis, the first English translator of this fable, paraphrased the text radically and shifted La Fontaine's preface to the end. There the Catholic reference is altered to something more in accord with his time: “Here is a fellow, you will say,/ Carried a knapsack t’other day, / In wretched, dismal, dirty plight,/ And now, forsooth, he’s dubb’d a Knight!” La Fontaine himself, however, had then gone on to say in his preface that he prefers repose, which is the divine lot, an Epicurean doctrine according to the commentators.
Commentators also point out echoes of Latin writers within the text. During his time at court, the fortune-seeker busies himself Se trouvant à tout, et n’arrivant à rien (being everywhere and getting nowhere), which may allude to the fable of “Tiberius Caesar and his Slave” by Phaedrus. The slave there is described as Multa agendo, nihil agens, “mightily employed and yet doing nothing”. When the man decides to go trading, La Fontaine reflects on the bravery of those who sail the seas:  

O, human hearts are made of bronze!
His must have been of adamant,
Who ventured first this route to try.In this case the allusion is to lines in an ode of Horace, Illi robur et aes triplex circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci commisit pelago ratem primus (Odes.1.3), which translates as “Oak round his breast and triple brass, the sailor wore, whose bark first ventured on the sea.”An image relative to the meaning area of La Fontaine's fable appeared in Barthélémy Aneau's emblem book Picta Poesis (1552) under the title Mulier Umbra Viri (man's feminine shadow). It pictures a man chasing his shadow while another is looking back at the shadow that the sun throws behind him, and is accompanied by a Latin poem: ""As the shadow that follows its body through the sun’s radiant light flees as it follows and follows as it flees, so also are the loves of womankind. If you want it, they don’t; if you don’t, they don’t need asking."" Much the same illustration was used by Theodore Beza in his Vrais Pourtraits (1581), but in this case relating to the pursuit of glory. The accompanying verse points out that glory (which is but a passing shadow) flees the proud but accompanies the humble person who does not seek fame. In this is summed up the substance of La Fontaine's fable of those who, in his own words, “court a flighty phantom”. He was himself followed at a distance by Ivan Krylov in that fabulist's more succinct but similar “The Man and his Shadow”, in the concluding commentary to which there are verbal echoes of La Fontaine's preface.


== References ==","<p><b>“The man who runs after fortune""</b> is the shortened title of La Fontaine's Fables, <i>L'homme qui court après la fortune et l’homme qui l’attend dans son lit</i> (The fortune-seeker and the layabout, VII.12). It is one of the few that is of La Fontaine's own invention but there are verbal echoes of other works. The title in the present tense points to the general lesson discussed in the prologue. The fable relates how an ambitious man suggests to his friend that they leave their small town together to seek their fortune. When his friend replies that he prefers to stay at home, the man departs to take up a position at Court. Not finding favour there, he next leaves to trade in the Orient but is no more successful. But when he gives up his pursuit and returns home at last, he find his friend in bed and Fortune sitting outside the door.

== Origin and variants ==
The phrase originates in a sermon by Jesus recorded in the Christian New Testament: Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves (Gospel of Matthew 7:15, King James Version) . The sermon then suggests that their true nature will be revealed by their actions (by their fruits shall ye know them, verse 16). In the centuries following, the phrase was used many times in the Latin writings of the Church Fathers and later on in European vernacular literature. A Latin proverb also emerged, Pelle sub agnina latitat mens saepe lupina (Under a sheep’s skin often hides a wolfish mind). Although the story of a wolf disguised as a sheep has been counted as one of Aesop's Fables in modern times, there is no record of a fable with this precise theme before the Middle Ages, although there are earlier fables of Aesop in Greek sources to which the Gospel parable might allude.
The first fable concerning a wolf that disguises itself in a sheep's skin is told by the 12th-century Greek rhetorician Nikephoros Basilakis in a work called Progymnasmata (rhetorical exercises). It is prefaced with the comment that 'You can get into trouble by wearing a disguise' and is followed by the illustrative story. 'A wolf once decided to change his nature by changing his appearance, and thus get plenty to eat. He put on a sheepskin and accompanied the flock to the pasture. The shepherd was fooled by the disguise. When night fell, the shepherd shut up the wolf in the fold with the rest of the sheep and as the fence was placed across the entrance, the sheepfold was securely closed off. But when the shepherd wanted a sheep for his supper, he took his knife and killed the wolf.'  The conclusion drawn is different from the Gospel story. In the former one is warned to beware of hypocritical evil-doers; Nikephoros warns that evil-doing carries its own penalty.

The next version does not appear until three centuries later in the Hecatomythium of the 15th-century Italian professor Laurentius Abstemius. In his telling, 'A wolf, dressed in a sheep's skin, blended himself in with the flock of sheep and every day killed one of the sheep. When the shepherd noticed this was happening, he hanged the wolf on a very tall tree. On other shepherds asking him why he had hanged a sheep, the shepherd answered: The skin is that of a sheep, but the activities were those of a wolf.' Abstemius' comment on the story follows the Biblical interpretation: 'people should be judged not by their outward demeanor but by their works, for many in sheep's clothing do the work of wolves'.Certain elements of this story are to be found in Aesop's fable of the shepherd who raised a wolf cub among his dogs. When it was grown, it secretly reverted to type. If a wolf stole a sheep and the dogs could not catch it, the guardian wolf continued the chase and shared the meal with the marauder. On other occasions it would kill a sheep and share the meat with the other dogs. Eventually the shepherd discovered what was happening and hanged the wolf. What may be a reference to this story occurs in an anonymous poem in the Greek Anthology in which a goat laments that it is made to suckle a wolf-cub,

The Greek fable is numbered 267 in the Perry Index. As in the case of The Walnut Tree, however, this would not have been the first time that Abstemius adapted one of Aesop's fables to fit a contemporary idiom, in this case that of the wolf in sheep's clothing. Though the commonest retelling of the story in English follows the version by Abstemius, it is often credited to Aesop.
Another variant fable by Aesop is number 234 in the Perry Index. This concerns a wolf that regularly comes to view the flock, but never attempts any harm. Eventually, the shepherd comes to trust it and on one occasion leaves the wolf on guard. He returns to find his flock decimated and blames himself for being taken in. In neither case is there the suggestion by Aesop that the wolf disguised itself as a sheep. 
Yet another variation on the disguise theme was included in the Cento favole morali (""100 moral fables"", 1570) of the Italian poet Giovanni Maria Verdizotti. In this the wolf dresses itself as a shepherd, but when it tries to imitate his call, it wakes the real shepherd and his dogs. Since the wolf is encumbered by its disguise, it cannot get away and is killed. This is the version followed in La Fontaine's Fables (III.3). The conclusion both poets draw is the same as that of Nikephoros. The story entered the English canon under the title ""The wolf turned shepherd"" in Roger L'Estrange's 1692 fable collection and in verse as ""The Wolf in Disguise"" in Robert Dodsley's Select fables of Esop and other fabulists (1765).


== Artistic interpretations ==
Earlier illustrations of the fable concentrated on the hanging of the wolf. More recently, the emphasis has been on the disguise. In France, the theme of the wolf disguised in shepherd's clothing is more common.A number of recent CDs are titled A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing, although most are references to the idiom and the fable is not mentioned in the words of any of the songs. The same is true of many songs that have the phrase as their title. One exception is the lyric by Tackhead on their 1991 CD Strange Things, which uses the fable for a satirical attack on Capitalist entrepreneurs.


== In zoology ==

Zoologists have repeatedly compared predatory animals which make use of aggressive mimicry to a wolf in sheep's clothing, including jumping spiders, lacewings, ant-mimicking aphids, hemipteran bugs mimicking chrysomelid beetles, bird-dropping spiders, orchid mantises, cichlid fish, and the zone-tailed hawk which flies with vultures; these animals have evolved to deceive their prey by appearing as other prey, or like angler fish and snapping turtles lure the prey by appearing as the prey's prey.
