<Final_Destination_3>,Final Destination 3,2006,United States,James Wong,,English,movie,"Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ryan Merrima",,,"Final Destination 3 is a 2006 American supernatural horror film directed by James Wong. A standalone sequel to Final Destination 2 (2003), it is the third installment in the Final Destination film series. Wong and Glen Morgan, who worked on the franchise's first film, wrote the screenplay. Final Destination 3 stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, and takes place years after the first film. Winstead plays Wendy Christensen, a high school graduate who has a premonition that a roller coaster she and her classmates are riding will derail. Although she saves some of them, Death begins hunting the survivors. Wendy realizes photographs she took at the amusement park contain clues about her classmates' death. With survivor and friend Kevin Fischer (Merriman), Wendy tries to use this knowledge to save the rest of them and ruin Death's scheme.
The film's development began shortly after the release of Final Destination 2; Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and a co-writer of the first two films, did not return for the third one. Unlike the second film, which was a direct sequel to the first, the producers envisioned Final Destination 3 as a stand-alone film. The idea of featuring a roller coaster derailment as the opening-scene disaster came from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan saw control as a major theme in the film. Casting began in March 2005 and concluded in April. Like the previous two installments, it was filmed in Vancouver, Canada. The first two weeks of the three-month shoot were spent filming the roller coaster's derailment.
Following its premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on February 2, 2006, the film was released in cinemas in the United States on February 10, 2006. The DVD, released on July 25, 2006, includes commentaries, documentaries, a deleted scene and an animated video. A special-edition DVD called ""Thrill Ride Edition"" includes a feature called ""Choose Their Fate"", which acts as an interactive film, allowing viewers to make decisions at specific points in the film that alter the course of the story.
Final Destination 3 received a mixed critical response. Some critics called the film formulaic and said it brought nothing new to the franchise, while others praised it for being enjoyable and fulfilling its audience's expectations. Two death scenes involving tanning beds and a nail gun, respectively, as well as Winstead's performance attracted positive comments from reviewers. The film was a financial success and, with box office receipts of nearly $118 million, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise at the time.

The title is derived from a devotional song titled Kanda Shasti Kavasam. The film follows a taxi driver who is suspected for attacking a don and goes on the run as the don's brother and gang start chasing after him.
Director Magizh Thirumeni conceived of the film when he was bedridden with viral fever and took 7 years to develop the story and characters. He initially discussed the title with director Gautham Vasudev Menon while working with him as an assistant on Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu, but it eventually stayed with him. Once the story was completed, he wanted an actor apt for this kind of action film; a protagonist with boy next door looks and demeanor. Arun Vijay was chosen for the role after being introduced to Thirumeni by a mutual friend. Similarly, he narrated the script to Mamta Mohandas who agreed to act in the film. With Thadaiyara Thaakka, he introduced Telugu film actor Vamsi Krishna and debutante Maha Gandhi as antagonists. The cinematography was handled by M. Sukumar, while Praveen K. L. and N. B. Srikanth jointly edited the film. The music was composed by S. Thaman, while Madhan Karky wrote the lyrics. Thirumeni was impressed with Anal Arasu's stunts and called them the film's major highlight. The film was shot in and around Chennai, and Arun Vijay performed the stunts by himself.The film was released theatrically on 1 June 2012, receiving acclaim for its action sequences, technical aspects and screenplay. However, it underperformed at the box office, which Thirumeni attributed to the low-key productions and publicity. The film slowly gained praise from viewers after the end of its theatrical run. Arun Vijay would go on to call it the best film in his career, during an interview for his 2015 film Yennai Arindhaal.",00031.jpg,00031.jpg,Asia

The film stars Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham and Priyanka Chopra, with Bobby Deol, Kirron Kher, Sushmita Mukherjee and Boman Irani in supporting roles. Dostana tells the story of two men who pretend to be gay to share an apartment with a girl; eventually, both fall in love with her.
Mansukhani conceived the film as a tale of three friends living together, drawing inspiration by his own experience. Wanting to add something different to the script, he later decided to introduce homosexuality (which he thought was unexplored by Bollywood) to shed light on the issue for the Indian audience. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's costumes, and Aki Narula designed costumes for the rest of the cast. The soundtrack was composed by Vishal–Shekhar and Anvita Dutt Guptan; Kumaar and Vishal Dadlani wrote its lyrics.
Principal photography took place in Miami, Florida over a two-month period in the first half of 2008. Dostana was the first mainstream Indian film with a gay element and has been credited for exploring a topic largely ignored by Hindi cinema. The film was released on 14 November 2008 to positive reviews, with praise for its performances, direction, music, costumes and style. A box-office success, Dostana grossed over ₹871 million, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.
Dostana received nine nominations for the 54th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Actor (Bachchan), and Best Music Director. The film was influential in creating fashion trends in India, with Chopra's silver sari (worn in the song ""Desi Girl"") becoming popular. Abraham's yellow trunks, Chopra's golden swimsuit and the actors' looks and style received considerable attention and were popular with youngsters. Dostana is regarded as one of the most stylish and trend-setting of Indian films, with Filmfare ranking it first in a 2013 poll. A sequel, Dostana 2, is scheduled to release in 2020.",00049.jpg,00049.jpg,Asia

This film follows Canada’s innovative youth outreach organization, The Remix Project as they travel to some of the most violent favelas in Rio de Janeiro and test their unique hip-hop outreach model on some of today’s most “unreachable” youth.
Remix Project co-founders Gavin Sheppard and Drex Inkredible join forces with ""Sandro"", an Ex-drug lord turned activist and Soldiers Never More project founder ""Farina"" in hopes of constructing a recording studio for disadvantaged youth in the Favela known as “The Enchanted Land” (Tera Encantada).
Gavin and Drex also bring four of their most hopeful students to Rio. The HUTUZ Hip-Hop festival, Latin America’s largest Hip-hop festival, is in full swing and sets the scene for these REMIX participants to test their skills.  The culture shock the Remixers experience and the perspectives they gain change their perspectives on poverty and redefine their personal circumstances at home.
As the hip-hop concert at HUTUZ approaches the Remixers decide to enlist the help of some young drummers from a local music outreach program from the notoriously violent neighborhood of Vila Aliança.  As rehearsals progress an unexpected bond is formed between these little drummers and the Remixers themselves. It is through these enthusiastic new friends that the Remix crew discovers the real challenges and brutal violence facing the youth in Rio today.
The film was Directed and Produced by Ravi Steve Khajuria.

Smith, based on Smith's 1993 novel of the same name. The film stars Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, and Bridget Fonda. Set in rural Minnesota, the story follows brothers Hank (Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Thornton), who, along with Jacob's friend Lou (Brent Briscoe), discover a crashed plane containing $4.4 million in cash. The three men and Hank's wife Sarah (Fonda) go to great lengths to keep the money a secret but begin to doubt each other's trust, resulting in lies, deceit and murder.
Development of the film began in 1993 before the novel was published. Mike Nichols purchased the film rights, and the project was picked up by Savoy Pictures. After Nichols stepped down, the film adaptation became mired in development hell, with Ben Stiller and John Dahl turning down opportunities to direct it. After Savoy closed in November 1997, the project was sold to Paramount Pictures. John Boorman was hired to direct, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Raimi. An international co-production between the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan, the film was financed by Mutual Film Company, its investors and Newmarket Capital Group, which allocated a budget of $17 million. Principal photography began in January 1998 and concluded in March after 55 days of filming in Wisconsin and Minnesota. The score was produced and composed by Danny Elfman.
A Simple Plan premiered at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was met with critical acclaim. The film's appearance at the festival preceded a limited release in the United States on December 11, 1998, followed by a general release in North America on January 22, 1999. It underperformed at the North American box office, grossing $16.3 million. Reviewers praised various aspects of the film's production, including the storytelling, performances and Raimi's direction.

The screenplay, written by Aline Brosh McKenna, is based on Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel of the same name. The film adaptation stars Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, a powerful fashion magazine editor, and Anne Hathaway as Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs, a college graduate who goes to New York City and lands a job as Priestly's co-assistant. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci co-star as co-assistant Emily Charlton and art director Nigel Kipling, respectively. Adrian Grenier, Simon Baker, and Tracie Thoms play key supporting roles.
In 2003, 20th Century Fox bought the rights to a film adaptation of Weisberger's novel before it was completed for publication. However, the project was not greenlit until Streep was cast in the lead role. Principal photography ran for 57 days, primarily taking place in New York from October 2005 to December later that year. Additional filming also occurred in Paris.
After premiering at the LA Film Festival on June 22, 2006, the film was theatrically released in the United States on June 30. The film received positive reviews from critics, with Streep's performance being singled out for praise. This earned her many award nominations, including an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, as well as a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Hathaway and Blunt also drew favorable reviews and nominations for their performances. The film grossed over $300 million worldwide, against its $41 million budget, and was the 12th highest-grossing film worldwide in 2006.
Although the film is set in the fashion world, most designers and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories to be used in the film, making it one of the most expensively costumed films in history. Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in particular.",00175.jpg,00175.jpg,North America

Following the writing and recording of the album, the band started a Pledgemusic project in July 2010 to get fan funding in order to master the album, promote it and tour it. They offered various exclusives to backers who pledged certain amounts. They succeeded in surpassing their target funding and released the album on their own label ILR.
It received generally positive reviews, with The Line of Best Fit describing it as ""a tender collection of songs that rely on passion rather than sentiment"".
Many reviewers noted a change in musical style, with musicOMH noting the lyrics were ""now looking to the future"" compared to their previous songs focused on historical people or events.

The album was released March 19, 2012, on Aural Apothecary and Columbia Records and was co-produced by Greg Kurstin and frontman James Mercer. The Shins' first studio album in five years, following the release of 2007's Wincing the Night Away, followed major lineup changes in the group: founding members Dave Hernandez (bass, guitar), Marty Crandall (keyboards) and Jesse Sandoval (drums) departed in 2009. Mercer deemed it an ""aesthetic decision"" to part ways with his bandmates, and in the interim, founded side project Broken Bells with Danger Mouse.
Primarily a collaboration between Mercer and Kurstin, the album features contributions from former members: Dave Hernandez, Martin Crandall, Eric D. Johnson and Ron Lewis; alongside drummer Joe Plummer, and other studio contributors, including Janet Weiss and Nik Freitas. Mercer penned lyrics based around his newfound fatherhood, the love for his family, as well as nostalgic memories of his childhood in Germany and his rough adolescent transition to the United States. Musically, Port of Morrow is inspired by 1970s German pop and is melodic and heavily layered, while adding a greater emphasis on electronic instrumentation.
The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and received largely favorable reviews from contemporary critics, with some deeming it among the band's best, while others felt it disjointed following the departure of its principal members. The lead single ""Simple Song"" charted within the top ten on the Billboard alternative charts, representing the band's highest peak chart-wise in their home country.

It was released digitally on 8 May 2016, with CD and vinyl releases in June 2016 through XL Recordings.
Radiohead recorded A Moon Shaped Pool in southern France with longtime producer Nigel Godrich. It features strings and choral vocals arranged by guitarist Jonny Greenwood and performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra. Several songs, such as ""True Love Waits"" and ""Burn the Witch"", were written years earlier. The lyrics address climate change, groupthink, and heartbreak; many critics saw them as a response to singer Thom Yorke's split from his partner Rachel Owen. The artwork was created by Yorke with longtime collaborator Stanley Donwood, who created abstract works by exposing his paintings to weather.
Radiohead promoted A Moon Shaped Pool with singles and videos for ""Burn the Witch"" and ""Daydreaming"", a viral campaign of social media and postcards, and a series of video vignettes. A world tour began in May 2016, with legs in 2017 and 2018 and headline performances at festivals including Glastonbury and Coachella. The tour included a performance in Tel Aviv, which drew criticism from supporters of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, a campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel.
A Moon Shaped Pool appeared in many publications' lists of the year's best albums. It was the fifth Radiohead album nominated for the Mercury Prize, and was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Song (for ""Burn the Witch"") at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. It topped the charts in several countries, becoming Radiohead's sixth number-one album in the UK, and was a bestseller on vinyl. It was certified gold in the UK and US in 2018.",00255.jpg,00255.jpg,

""I wanted it to be the kind of record that could be played by anyone, but not too obvious. You know, the London Symphony Orchestra doesn't have to do the ballads, Johnny Cash doesn't have to do the country songs. I don't like to be that predictable. I like surprises,"" he said.
McLennan toured the US, Europe and Australia in 1995 to promote the album, playing with musicians including Anna Burley and Dave Foley from The Killjoys, and Phil Kakulas from Blackeyed Susans. His American performances received highly favourable reviews from The New York Times and Rolling Stone, which called McLennan ""one of the world's great songwriters"".This was the first of his solo albums on which he went by ""Grant,"" instead of ""G.W."" on the previous two.

With the group's future uncertain, the members took time off to focus on other projects, while Koppes began to establish a solo career with his new group, The Well, which included former band mate Richard Ploog. Kilbey began a Jack Frost collaboration with Grant McLennan (of The Go-Betweens) and Willson-Piper returned to the studio with UK group All About Eve, to record their album Ultraviolet.
Arista Records decided to stand by their contract with the band and back another album, despite the loss of Koppes, and so Kilbey and Willson-Piper began writing new material. When it became clear that drummer Daugherty would not be returning to the fold either, the remaining two took the opportunity to approach their music from new perspectives, abandoning their long-established roles and stylistic elements in favour of experimentation, spontaneity and electronica. Song construction became freer, with each musician playing multiple tracks on various instruments, to be cut down and refined into finished pieces later. The two likened their approach to a sculptor's creative process, the pieces gradually taking shape as the work went on.
Early in 1994, they brought in Willson-Piper's childhood friend Andy 'Dare' Mason to produce, record and mix the album. It was recorded at Sydney's Karmic Hit Studios and mixed at Karmic Hit and Studios 301, except ""The Maven"", ""Leave Your Clothes On"" & ""Freeze to Burn"", which were recorded and mixed at Fryshuset, Stockholm, Sweden by Martin Rössel. New Zealand drummer Tim Powles was hired for the Sydney sessions, having already played with Kilbey on the Jack Frost project. Considered temporary at the time, Powles would soon become a permanent member of the band and is still with them over 20 years later.
Sometime Anywhere was generally well-received and peaked in the Australian Top 30. A 7-track bonus disc, entitled Somewhere Else, was included with the initial pressings. It was described as a ""rich, dark, epic release which picked up where Priest=Aura left off, with lush, lengthy tracks"". However, sales were lower than their previous studio albums and the first single, ""Two Places at Once"", did not chart. Promotion was minimal as Arista saw insufficient commercial promise in the release. With another commercially unsuccessful album on their hands, Arista did not renew The Church's contract and pulled financial support for a tour. Ambitious plans to stage full electric shows were scaled back, leaving Kilbey and Willson-Piper with only a short run of acoustic gigs as a duo.
In 2005 the album was remastered and reissued in Australia by EMI, with a second disc which included all of the Somewhere Else tracks except ""Drought"" (which was moved to Priest=Aura), plus the radio and video edits of ""Two Places at Once"".
Kilbey named his blog after the Somewhere Else track ""The Time Being"".",00295.jpg,00295.jpg,

It was released by the Sanctuary Records Group and Columbia Records on January 26, 2004 in the United States. Do You Know ""straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R&B"" and is described as portraying ""a more intimate side of Michelle"". It contains a greater percentage of mid and up-tempo songs, along with a much heavier and grander use of live instrumentation. Williams contributed lyrically to the album as she did with her debut album, co-writing a total of six songs. However, Do You Know is much more diverse, lyrically, than its predecessor Heart to Yours, covering the themes of ""spiritual"" and ""carnal"" love and contains retrospective songs about Williams' career thus far, whilst still retaining the inspirational and encouraging lyrics that characterised Heart to Yours.In the US, Do You Know found fair success on Billboard's component charts; peaking at number two on the Gospel Albums chart, number three on the Christian Albums chart and number twenty-eight on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. However, the album peaked at one-hundred-and-twenty on the Billboard 200, making it Williams' lowest-charting album. Though the album was well received by critics, it sold only 10,000 copies in its first week of release. Despite this, the album was later re-released, including two new tracks and has now sold over 78,000 copies in the US alone as of 2008. The album gained Williams a nomination for ""Best Gospel Act"" at the 2004 MOBO Awards.",00306.jpg,00306.jpg,

The album was released on January 1, 2010 through RCA Records and distributed through Sony Music Entertainment. Kesha worked on the album with a variety of record producers and songwriters such as Lukasz ""Dr. Luke"" Gottwald, Benny Blanco, David Gamson, Greg Kurstin, Max Martin and others. Kesha had been recording demos for several years when one eventually ended up in the hands of Samantha Cox, senior director of writer/publisher relations at BMI. Cox passed along the demo and it ended up in the hands of Gottwald, who decided to have Kesha perform on the song ""Right Round"" with American rapper Flo Rida. Within two months, the song became a hit in multiple countries around the world. The event led to Kesha being sought after by many major labels, and she eventually signed a multi-album deal with RCA Records.
Musically, Animal draws from the electropop genre, while incorporating elements of dance-pop in its production and beats. Lyrically, the majority of the album's songs are based on Kesha's past life experiences of love, heartbreak, boys, and having a good time. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some appreciated its fun, carefree nature, while others dismissed it as juvenile and said that it seemed insincere. The album attained chart success, debuting at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, the Billboard 200 in the United States and the IFPI Greece Albums Chart, while charting within the top ten in seven other countries. In December 2018, Animal was certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 3 million copies in the United States and has now sold over 9 million copies worldwide as of 2019.Four singles were released from the album. Its lead single, ""Tik Tok"", was released on August 7, 2009 and was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in eleven countries. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and stayed at the top for nine consecutive weeks. The song sold 12.8 million digital copies worldwide in 2010, making it the best-selling single of the year; 6,800,000 of those downloads were sold in the United States alone, making it at the time the sixth best-selling song in digital history. It has since sold over fifteen million copies worldwide, and as of August 7, 2014 (exactly five years after its release), it's become the second best-selling digital single worldwide. The album's second, third and fourth singles (""Blah Blah Blah"", ""Your Love Is My Drug"" and ""Take It Off"") all achieved similar success, reaching the top ten in multiple countries, including Australia, Canada and the United States. The album's commercial success led to its nomination for the Juno Award for Best International Album at the Juno Awards of 2011.",00307.jpg,00307.jpg,

It was the group's first album to feature keyboard player and guitarist Julia Nagle and the last to feature Brix Smith, while longtime guitarist Craig Scanlon quit the group in late 1995 during troubled recording sessions for ""The Chiselers"" single which preceded the album. A version of ""The Chiselers"" is included on the album as ""Interlude/Chilinism"".
Brix Smith told Simon Ford that The Light User Syndrome was recorded very quickly, with Mark E. Smith absent for much of the recording, delivering nearly all his vocals on the final day. Although Julia Nagle remembers recording the vocals took more than a week. Smith himself claimed half the vocals were actually just guide vocals, which he found had been mixed as the final vocals when he took a day off from the studio. Despite this, alternate versions of many of the album's tracks featured heavily across the series of compilation albums issued by the Receiver label in the late 1990s. The album also features some vocals from producer Mike Bennett, as well as a rare lead vocal from drummer and guitarist Karl Burns on a cover version of Johnny Paycheck's ""Stay Away (Ol' White Train).""
The tour supporting the album was disastrous due to Smith's heavy drinking and misbehaviour, with Brix walking out of the group after the soundcheck at Motherwell Concert Hall (although she would return for one last gig at the Forum in London) and a gig in Worthing being declared by long-serving bassist Steve Hanley to be the worst Fall gig ever. By the end of the year, they were playing without Brix and Burns, (Julia Nagle took one Christmas concert off to be with her son).

Brains' labelmates Boyz II Men were featured on the album's second single ""Brainstorming"", as well as the song entitled ""Boyz II Men (The Sequel)"". The latter song's chorus was interpolated in the group's own sophomore album, II (1994).",00383.jpg,00383.jpg,

It was a soundtrack for the Sci-Fi Award-winning UPN animated children's computer-generated television series Van Pires, which only aired between 1997 and 1998, shooting 13 episodes, which Entwistle had been involved with. The album was not officially released as a collection. Some of the tracks appear on his solo compilation album So Who's the Bass Player? The Ox Anthology, despite this. Notably, this album was not re-released alongside Entwistle's other solo studio albums in 2005.
The song ""Bogey Man"" was originally written for The Who's 1978 album Who Are You by John Entwistle, but was rejected by the band for being too humorous. A demo was recorded by Entwistle and Keith Moon. The demo went largely forgotten, until Entwistle resorted to his old demos for material the soundtrack to the 1997 children's television programme Van Pires, to help him meet a contract which agreed he would write and record 13 new songs and a theme tune in 3 months. When the band's drummer, Steve Luongo heard the demo, he recognized Keith Moon's drumming on the demo, and the band decided to record a new version of the song with Moon's original drum track.",00384.jpg,00384.jpg,

The album received mixed reviews, failing to obtain the acclaim of Tarkus or Brain Salad Surgery.

It was released on 18 October 2004.
After having been absent for the previous two studio albums, Peter Dolving was once again back in the band and provided the vocals for rEVOLVEr. He would remain with the band until he left once again in 2012.
As the title on the album indicates with its stylized typography (i.e. with the word ""EVOLVE"" printed in upper case letters between the two lower case r's), the band made a conscious decision to tweak (or ""evolve"") its songwriting on this album. As a result, rEVOLVEr contains some elements that were absent on previous The Haunted albums. Although the album still contains examples of the band's familiar thrash metal sound (e.g. ""No Compromise"", ""Sabotage"", ""Sweet Relief""), it features considerably more mid-paced riffing (e.g. ""99"", ""Burnt to a Shell"", ""Fire Alive"") than in any of their previous albums. Two of the tracks even have ballad elements interspersed in them (""Abysmal"" and ""My Shadow"").
Also notable is that rEVOLVEr has quite a few instances of clean singing in it, although the vast majority of the vocal tracking was still done in The Haunted's traditional hardcore/metalcore style of screaming.
A limited edition digipak of this CD contained two bonus tracks, and different artwork.
A music video was made for ""No Compromise"" which featured Barney Greenway.",00387.jpg,00387.jpg,

The album was released on May 5, 2015 through Deathwish Inc. Though Coliseum previously released the ""True Quiet""/""Last Wave"" single in 2009 and an expanded reissue of their debut album Coliseum in 2014 through Deathwish, Anxiety's Kiss is the band's first full-length album of new material released through the label. The album was produced by J. Robbins of Jawbox fame, who previously produced Coliseum's 2011 EP Parasites and 2013 studio album Sister Faith. 
Sonically, Anxiety's Kiss sees the band incorporating more post-punk, industrial music and synthesizers into their post-hardcore sound. When asked how fans might react to Coliseum's new sound for Anxiety's Kiss, vocalist and guitarist Ryan Patterson said: ""Every album changes and everybody is shocked at the time that happens, so I think that's made it difficult for us to really build a big fanbase because every time we put out a record—I don't know if it's alienating everybody—but it's completely erasing the rulebook.""To promote the album, coinciding with the album's announcement, Coliseum released a music video for the opening track ""We Are the Water"" directed by Max Moore. The announcement was followed by a short February/March 2015 tour, including dates with Old Man Gloom. Coliseum also released a music video for ""Sunlight in a Snowstorm"" and a lyric video for ""Course Correction"" before the album's official release date. The band's first tour directly in support of Anxiety's Kiss will be a June 2015 US tour with United Nations and Child Bite.Timothy Monger of AllMusic gave the album four-out-of-five stars and said, ""Building on the strong foundation of their last album, Anxiety's Kiss adds even more sonic and emotional variety to Coliseum's sound, and is easily their most interesting album to date.""",00032.png,00032.png,

While working for the national Norwegian television network, Åsne Seierstad was in Yugoslavia (today's Serbia) during the Kosovo War and NATO bombing of the country of 1999. She also recorded the events of the democratic revolution which overthrew Slobodan Milošević in October 2000.
In her book, Seierstad follows thirteen people from different parts of the country who represent a rough cross-section of Serbia - people of varying backgrounds and political beliefs. She describes their lives and records their thoughts, providing a degree of insight into Serbia's national psyche and its historical causes. She visited Serbia three times during the book. Firstly in 1999, after the NATO bombing campaign, when Milosevic is still in power and when UN sanctions are still in place. She visited again during the democratic revolution in 2000. Her final visit came in 2004 after the assassination of the Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and the deportation of alleged war criminals (including Slobodan Milosevic himself) to the ICTY in The Hague, with most of her characters feeling disillusioned with the country's lack of progress.
As well as talking about ordinary Serbians, including a displaced Serbian family from Kosovo, Seierstad also writes about her interviews with famous Serbian politicians from both Milošević's Socialist Party and the Democratic parties of Serbia, as well as television personalities and the musician Rambo Amadeus.",,,Europe

The Wages of Destruction won the Wolfson History Prize and the 2007 Longman/History Today Book of the Year Prize. It was published to critical praise from such authors as Michael Burleigh, Richard Overy and Niall Ferguson.
In the book Tooze writes that having failed to defeat Britain in 1940, the economic logic of the war drove the Nazis to invade the Soviet Union. Hitler was constrained to invade the Soviet Union in 1941 to obtain the natural resources necessary to challenge the economic superpowers of the United States and the British Empire. Operation Barbarossa sealed the fate of the third Reich because it was resource constraints that made victory against the Soviet Union impossible, especially when the Soviet Union received supplies from Britain and the US to supplement the resources remaining under Soviet control.
The book makes the case for the economic impact of the British and then Anglo-American strategic bombing campaign (though argues that the wrong targets were often selected), challenges the idea of an economic miracle under Albert Speer and rejects the idea that the German economy could have mobilised significantly more women for the war economy.",,,Europe

Comprising ten notebooks, it is considered by leading historians as ""an important piece of historical literature."" The editors of the German magazine Der Spiegel called it ""an image of Nazi Germany that has never existed before in such a vivid, concise and challenging form.""  Kellner began his 861-page diary on September 1, 1939, and wrote his last entry on May 17, 1945. In 1968 he gave the diary to his American grandson, Robert Scott Kellner, to translate into English and to bring it to the attention of the public.The diary has been on exhibit in museums in America and Germany. The first exhibit was at the George Bush Presidential Library in April and May 2005 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, which took place on May 8, 1945. The exhibit led to a collaboration between Robert Scott Kellner and the Holocaust Literature Research Unit at the University of Giessen in Germany to publish the diary in Germany.

The Book tries to answer questions by quoting similarities with other religion and without trying to show any other religion in a bad light, explains that how the broadness of Religion, which gives freedom to believe in god and at the same time be an atheist, pray the Idols or only the holy scriptures has led to many wrong beliefs about the religion.

It was published in hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper as a form of therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was telling the truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.
The book recounts Dickinson's early life where she states she experienced child abuse from her father, and moves forward describing her experiences throughout her career as a model. Dickinson explains her struggle with substance dependence upon drugs and alcohol during her career. The author discusses her time as a representative for companies including Virginia Slims, Max Factor, and Hush Puppies; and her success appearing on the covers of magazines including: Vogue, Elle, Harper's Bazaar, and Cosmo. While performing work as a model she takes the time to gain knowledge about the craft of photography and fashion. Dickinson describes how she originated the term ""supermodel"". No Lifeguard on Duty cautions about the tendency towards insecurity in celebrity culture.
No Lifeguard on Duty received a favorable reception from multiple publications. Film rights to the book were purchased by Warner Bros. in 2004. Women's Wear Daily praised the author's comedic style in the work. Knight Ridder Newspapers wrote positively of the author's courage at describing difficult experiences from her past. The New York Observer found the writing style of the book to have a good flow throughout. Publishers Weekly wrote: ""Dickinson comes across as a triumphant survivor.""Dickinson's book had a positive impact on her career. Because of reading the book, Tyra Banks decided to bring Dickinson on board as a judge on her new program America's Next Top Model in 2003. Dickinson served as a judge on the program for a total of four seasons before being replaced by Twiggy Lawson. Oxygen Network subsequently hired her for its new program centered on the author's efforts to start her own company; the program launched in 2006 titled: The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency.",00481.jpg,00481.jpg,North America

Lukacs. The book is the story of the only large-scale group of American prisoners of war to escape from a Japanese prison camp in the Pacific Theater during World War II.  The ten escaped POWs were the first to break the news of the infamous Bataan Death March and other atrocities committed by the Japanese to the world.The ten POWs, after two months of planning and preparation, escaped from Davao Penal Colony on Mindanao in the Philippines on April 4, 1943, and were led by Lt. William Dyess and assisted by two Filipino convicts. The American prisoners spent a year in captivity, and after escape spent several months on the run. The group underwent unspeakable conditions, and once rescued were able to convey the realities of Japanese POW camps to the U.S. government, eventually prompting increased U.S. military action in the Pacific.Lukacs constructed the book's narrative – including the grim details of the three-week-long Bataan Death March, the grisly treatment of the prisoners of war by the Japanese, and the difficult escape itself – through interviews with surviving characters, archival research, personal correspondence, and periodicals. He also visited the battlefields of Bataan and Corregidor, as well as the prison itself, which remains in use by the government of the Republic of the Philippines.The book was reviewed favorably by publications including Pittsburgh Magazine, World War II Magazine, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Arizona Republic, San Angelo Standard-Times, and Seattle Weekly.  Booklist and Kirkus Reviews also gave the book plaudits. Lukacs presented a one-hour talk about the book televised by C-SPAN at the MacArthur Memorial in June 2010. The author also received the 2011 Senator John Heinz Community Advocate Award from the Veterans’ Leadership Program of Pittsburgh, for the book. A documentary film helmed by Lukacs, 4-4-43, was created about the book's subject matter.",00483.jpg,00483.jpg,

Goldhagen argues that eliminationist antisemitism was the cornerstone of German national identity, was unique to Germany, and because of it ordinary German conscripts killed Jews willingly. Goldhagen asserts that this mentality grew out of medieval attitudes rooted in religion and was later secularized.
The book challenges several common ideas about the Holocaust that Goldhagen believes to be myths. These ""myths"" include the idea that most Germans did not know about the Holocaust; that only the SS, and not average members of the Wehrmacht, participated in murdering Jews; and that genocidal antisemitism was a uniquely Nazi ideology without historical antecedents. 
The book, which began as a Harvard doctoral dissertation, was written largely as an answer to Christopher Browning's 1992 book Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland. Much of Goldhagen's book is concerned with the actions of the same Reserve Battalion 101 of the Nazi German Ordnungspolizei and his narrative challenges numerous aspects of Browning's book. Goldhagen had already indicated his opposition to Browning's thesis in a review of Ordinary Men in the July 13, 1992, edition of The New Republic titled ""The Evil of Banality"". His doctoral dissertation, The Nazi Executioners: A Study of Their Behavior and the Causation of Genocide, won the American Political Science Association's 1994 Gabriel A. Almond Award for the best dissertation in the field of comparative politics.Goldhagen's book stoked controversy and debate in Germany and the United States. Some historians have characterized its reception as an extension of the Historikerstreit, the German historiographical debate of the 1980s that sought to explain Nazi history. The book was a ""publishing phenomenon"", achieving fame in both the United States and Germany, despite its ""mostly scathing"" reception among historians, who were unusually vocal in condemning it as ahistorical and, in the words of Holocaust historian Raul Hilberg, ""totally wrong about everything"" and ""worthless"".Hitler's Willing Executioners won the Democracy Prize of the Journal for German and International Politics. The Harvard Gazette asserted that the selection was the result of Goldhagen's book having ""helped sharpen public understanding about the past during a period of radical change in Germany"".",00492.jpg,00492.jpg,North America

The memoirs, written in 1992 and published in eight volumes, retell Kim's life story through his childhood to the time of Korean resistance. Initially, a total of 30 volumes were planned but Kim Il-sung died in 1994 after just six volumes; the seventh and eight volumes were published posthumously. The work reveals early influences of religious and literary ideas on Kim's thinking. An important part of North Korean literature, With the Century is held as a valuable if somewhat unreliable insight into the nation's modern history under late colonial Korea. The book is considered one of a few North Korean primary sources widely available in the West and as notable research material for North Korean studies.

It discusses interactions between African Americans and Japanese Americans in the Los Angeles area from the 1920s through the 1990s. Kurashige argued that the distinct civil rights' movements of both the African-Americans and the Japanese Americans in Los Angeles were affected by the ""shifting grounds of race""; aspects of their movements overlapped but they used distinct methods and strategies. On many occasions members of the two ethnic groups lived in proximity to one another. Japanese people focused on business as they were unable to participate in politics, since they were not U.S. citizens. African-Americans, who were U.S. citizens, were able to participate in politics while having less footing in the business world. The focus on black-Japanese relations is distinct from the usual tendency of race-related nonfiction works to focus on white-black relations. Kurashige emphasized the presence of ""triangular relations"" among blacks, Japanese, and the politically dominant white political center.David O. Sears of the University of California, Los Angeles wrote that the book is a part of a ""second wave"" of scholarship discussing 20th century race and ethnicity-related effects on cities in the northern-influenced United States.",00007.gif,00007.gif,North America

<The_Merger_of_Knowledge_with_Power>,The Merger of Knowledge with Power,1990,United Kingdom,Jerome Ravetz,,English,book,Mansell,,,"The Merger of Knowledge with Power: Essays in Critical Science is a book written in 1990 by Jerome Ravetz.
The book contains a series of essays which touch upon science and policy, the role of ideologies in scientific progress, and broader themes of history and philosophy of Science, with critical attention to points of friction between science and society. ""We can best understand this anthology as a 20-year continuation of his seminal
study, Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems"".In this book Ravetz invites us to consider science and its prodigious achievements on the face of the growing awareness that science is also at the root of many modern problems. In the opening essay ""A critical awareness of science"" he suggests adopting the perspective of the poor, and considering where science has failed them.
In the  essay on ""Francis Bacon and the Reform of Philosophy"" Ravetz argues that Bacon's audacious reform programme owed much more to his religion views, hopes and expectation than is normally accounted for. The Chapter ""Ideological Commitment in the Philosophy of Science' offers Ravetz's first hand reading of the relevance of ideology in the philosophies of science of Karl Popper, 
Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend.
The book has detailed discussions of risks and regulation and science's role therein, and a critique of 'reckless' science (""Hardware and Fantasy in Military Technology""). Ravetz also presents his insight on the use of ignorance (""Usable Knowledge, Usable Ignorance: Incomplete Science with Policy Implications""), the Gaia hypothesis, how to constructively tackle the problems of quality control of quantitative information, and the need for ""A new social contract for science"". For Carrozza (2015)  this book (p. 284) investigates the two interrelated processes
of the scientization of politics and of the politicization of expertise ""in the spirit of a general call for renewing
the social contract between science and society"".",,,Europe

Although Putin was elected with promises to rein in the oligarchs who had emerged in the 1990s, Dawisha writes that Putin transformed ""an oligarchy independent of, and more powerful than, the state into a corporatist structure in which oligarchs served at the pleasure of state officials, who themselves gained and exercised economic control... both for the state and for themselves.""  As a result, 110 individuals control 35% of Russia's wealth, according to Dawisha. Whereas scholars have traditionally viewed Putin's Russia as a democracy in the process of failing, Dawisha argues that ""from the beginning Putin and his circle sought to create an authoritarian regime ruled by a close-knit cabal... who used democracy for decoration rather than direction.""",00531.jpg,00531.jpg,

The book consists of a foreword by the President of the Ontario Black History Society, Rosemary Sadlier, OOnt and work by various youth on issues of identity, belonging, and Canadian Black History.
The anthology was created in partnership with the Office of the Provincial Advocate of Children and Youth in Ontario a commission of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario which puts youth at its centre and uses rights to improve the lives and conditions of youth in systems of care in Ontario. The anthology was started in January 2012 and was published by General Store Publishing House in July 2012.
The title ""Basodee"" comes from the Trinidadian creole word of the same name meaning ""half-conscious"" and ""disoriented."" The term was chosen as the title of the book to express the confusion and identity crisis of Black Canadian youth.
The book consists of photography, essays, short stories and poetry by 13 youth expressing what it is to be young, Black and Canadian. Many are immigrants to the country or first-generation Canadians. Some have had experience with the mental health or criminal justice system and some are in care. Each shares their personal stories and views on what it means to be Black and Canadian today.",00535.jpg,00535.jpg,North America

Snyder that was first published by Basic Books on October 28, 2010. In the book, Snyder examines the political, cultural and ideological context tied to a specific region of Central and Eastern Europe, where Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union and Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany committed mass killings of an estimated 14 million noncombatants between 1933 and 1945, the majority outside the death camps of the Holocaust. Snyder's thesis is that the ""bloodlands"", a region that is now Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), northeastern Romania, and the westernmost fringes of Russia, is the area that the regimes of Stalin and Hitler, despite their conflicting goals, interacted to increase suffering and bloodshed many times worse than any seen in western history. Snyder notes similarities between the two totalitarian regimes and also the enabling interactions that reinforced the destruction and the suffering that were brought to bear on noncombatants. Making use of many new primary and secondary sources from Central and Eastern Europe, Snyder brings scholarship to many forgotten, misunderstood, or incorrectly-remembered parts of the history, and he particularly notes that most of the victims were killed outside the concentration camps of the respective regimes. Snyder in 2011 estimated that Hitler killed more than Stalin.The book earned many positive reviews and has been called ""revisionist history of the best kind"". It was awarded numerous prizes, including the 2013 Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought.",00543.jpg,00543.jpg,

During the 1948 Palestine war, around 720,000 Palestinian Arabs out of the 900,000 who lived in the territories that became Israel fled or were expelled from their homes. The causes of this exodus are controversial and debated by historians. In his own words, Ilan Pappé ""want[s] to make the case for the paradigm of ethnic cleansing and use[s] it to replace the paradigm of war as the basis for the scholarly research of, and public debate about, 1948.""The thesis of the book is that the forced move of Palestinians to the Arab world was an objective of the Zionist movement and a must for the desired character of the Jewish state. According to Pappé, the 1948 Palestinian exodus resulted from a planned ethnic cleansing of Palestine that was implemented by the Zionist movement leaders, mainly David Ben-Gurion and the other ten members of his ""consultancy group"" as referred to by Pappé. The book argues that the ethnic cleansing was put into effect through systematic expulsions of about 500 Arab villages, as well as terrorist attacks executed mainly by members of the Irgun and Haganah troops against the civilian population. Ilan Pappé also refers to Plan Dalet and to the village files as a proof of the planned expulsions.",00544.jpg,00544.jpg,Asia

Jones, in which he seeks to explain the universality of dragon images in the folklore of human societies. In the introduction, Jones conducts a survey of dragon myths from cultures around the world and argues that certain aspects of dragons or dragon-like mythical creatures are found very widely. He claims that even the Inuit have a reptilian dragon-like monster, even though (living in a frigid environment unsuited for cold-blooded animals) they had never seen an actual reptile.
Jones then argues against the common hypothesis that dragon myths might be motivated by primitive discoveries of dinosaur fossils (he argues that there are widespread traits of dragons in folklore which are not observable from fossils), and claims that the common traits of dragons seem to be an amalgam of the principal predators of our ancestral hominids, which he names as the raptors, great cats (especially leopards) and pythons.
The hypothesis to which Jones conforms is that over millions of years of evolution, members of a species will evolve an instinctive fear of their predators, and he proposes ways in which these fearful images may be merged in artistic or cultural expression to create the dragon image and, perhaps, other kinds of hybrid monster.
Finally he suggests sociological reasons for why such images may be perceived differently at different stages of a culture to try to explain why  Chinese dragons are considered basically good and representative of government, but the great majority (although not all) European dragons are evil and often represent chaos.",00565.jpg,00565.jpg,

It was published in 2006 by the Penguin Group. By drawing upon research on the human genome, the book attempts to piece together what Wade calls ""two vanished periods"": the five million years of human evolution from the development of bipedalism leading up to behavioural modernity around 50,000 years ago, and the 45,000 subsequent years of prehistory.
Wade asserts that there is a clear continuity from the earlier apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution can be attributed to the physical environment, he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself.
After humans migrated out of their ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates and challenges. Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.
The book received generally positive reviews, but some criticised the use of the term ""race"" and the implications of differences between them. In 2007, it won the Science in Society Journalism Award from the National Association of Science Writers.",00569.jpg,00569.jpg,North America

Oreskes and Conway write that in each case ""keeping the controversy alive"" by spreading doubt and confusion after a scientific consensus had been reached was the basic strategy of those opposing action. In particular, they show that Fred Seitz, Fred Singer, and a few other contrarian scientists joined forces with conservative think tanks and private corporations to challenge the scientific consensus on many contemporary issues.Some of the book's subjects have been critical of the book, but most reviewers received it favorably.

Maher targets American citizens in this publication and notes that the American people are much too wasteful, and while Maher mainly critiques the methods the United States is using to fight the War on Terrorism, he also addresses issues such as oil dependency, environmental destruction, religion, the War on Drugs and foreign relations.In the book, Maher uses vintage World War II propaganda posters and manipulates the images to apply to the current issues facing the world and the United States, and he uses each image as the introduction to each new chapter and as the basis for several pages of writing.  While written in a humorous style, the comments and suggestions that Maher makes that deal with global issues are serious and genuine.  He mentions the Bush Doctrine, and says that if he were president, countries that harbor terrorists  who bring nuclear weapons into the US will be considered to have fired a missile at the United States. Maher concludes the book with his analysis of how the United States has behaved in comparison to other superpowers in the past, and pushes the position that the US would have acted ""better"" than any other nation in such a position of power.

Published in the UK on 1 September 2010, it covers events from when he became leader of the Labour Party in 1994 and transformed it into ""New Labour"", holding power for a party record three successive terms, to his resignation and replacement as Prime Minister by his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown. Blair donated his £4.6 million advance, and all subsequent royalties, to the British Armed Forces charity The Royal British Legion. It became the fastest-selling autobiography of all time at the bookstore chain Waterstones. Promotional events were marked by anti-war protests.
Two of the book's major topics are the strains in Blair's relationship with Brown after Blair allegedly reneged on the pair's 1994 agreement to step down as Prime Minister much earlier, and his controversial decision to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Blair discusses Labour's future after the 2010 general election, his relations with the Royal Family, and how he came to respect President George W. Bush. Reviews were mixed; some criticised Blair's writing style, but others called it candid.
Gordon Brown was reportedly unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled relationship with his Chancellor that were absent from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be changed for the better when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.",00606.jpg,00606.jpg,Europe

It details the history of fractional reserve banking and the influence that bankers have had on monetary policy over the last few centuries.Rothbard argues that the claim that the Federal Reserve is designed to fight inflation is sophistry, that price inflation is caused only by an increase in the money supply, and that since only banks increase the money supply, then banks, including the Federal Reserve, are the only source of inflation. He writes:

Unlike the days of the gold standard, it is impossible for the Federal Reserve to go bankrupt; it holds the legal monopoly of counterfeiting (of creating money out of thin air) in the entire country.

It was edited by Glenn O'Brien and published by Warner Books, Maverick and Callaway. The book features adult content including softcore pornography and simulations of sexual acts including sadomasochism.
Madonna developed Sex after Judith Regan of Simon & Schuster publishers suggested a book of erotic photographs. She wrote it as a character named ""Mistress Dita"", inspired by 1930s film actress Dita Parlo. It was influenced by punk rock and fashion figures including Guy Bourdin, Helmut Newton and Robert Mapplethorpe. The photos were shot in early 1992 in New York City and Miami, in locations including hotels, burlesque theaters, and city streets. The book includes cameos by actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, and socialite Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg. The cover is made of aluminium, spiral bound and wrapped in a Mylar sheet.
Madonna's publishers were apprehensive about the release and the book's commercial potential. It was released on October 21, 1992, the day after Madonna's fifth studio album Erotica. A CD single with the song ""Erotic"" was also packaged with the book. It sold over 150,000 copies on its first day, and remains the fastest-selling coffee table book. Sex topped the New York Times Best Seller list and went on to sell more than 1.5 million copies worldwide.
Sex attracted extensive media attention and backlash, but Madonna remains unapologetic. Though it initially received negative reviews from fans and critics, who felt she had ""gone too far"", later reviews have been more positive, with academics deeming it a defining phase in Madonna's career. Sex is noted for its social and cultural impact and is considered a bold post-feminist work. It has become one of the most sought-after out-of-print books.",00621.jpg,00621.jpg,North America

The stories contained in the book were written between 1980 and 2005, and published in Japan in various magazines and collections. The contents of this compilation was selected by Murakami and first published in English translation in 2006 (its Japanese counterpart was released later in 2009). Around half the stories were translated by Philip Gabriel with the other half being translated by Jay Rubin. In this collection, the stories alternate between the two translators for the most part.
Murakami considers this to be his first real English-language collection of short stories since The Elephant Vanishes (1993) and considers after the quake (2000) to be more akin to a concept album, as its stories were designed to produce a cumulative effect.In the introductory notes to the English-language edition of Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman, Murakami declares, ""I find writing novels a challenge, writing stories a joy. If writing novels is like planting a forest, then writing short stories is more like planting a garden.""",00627.jpg,00627.jpg,Asia
<The_Spitting_Image>,The Spitting Image,1998,United States,Jerry Lembcke,,English,book,,,,"The Spitting Image: Myth, Memory and the Legacy of Vietnam is a 1998 book by Vietnam veteran and sociology professor Jerry Lembcke. The book is an analysis of the widely believed narrative that American soldiers were spat upon and insulted by anti-war protesters upon returning home from the Vietnam War. The book examines the origin of the earliest stories; the popularization of the ""spat-upon image"" through Hollywood films and other media, and the role of print news media in perpetuating the now iconic image through which the history of the war and anti-war movement has come to be represented.
Lembcke contrasts the absence of credible evidence of spitting by anti-war activists with the large body of evidence showing a mutually supportive, empathetic relationship between veterans and anti-war forces. The book documents the efforts of the Nixon Administration to drive a wedge between military servicemen and the anti-war movement by portraying democratic dissent as betrayal of the troops, effectively redirecting blame for failure in Vietnam onto protesters. Coupled with American society's exaggeration of medical conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and drug abuse among veterans to the point of broadly vilifying the Vietnam veteran as mentally unfit, emotionally volatile and a ""loser"" and ""victim"", the collective memory about Vietnam has been refocused onto the veteran and away from the war. Lembcke equates this disparagement of the anti-war movement and veterans with the similar stab-in-the-back myths propagated by Germany and France after their war defeats, as an alibi for why they lost the war. Lembcke details the resurrection of this myth of the spat-upon veteran by later administrations during subsequent Gulf War efforts as a way of silencing public dissent.",,,North America

Following the beginnings of his humanitarian efforts, Mortenson co-founded the Central Asia Institute (CAI), a non-profit group that has reported overseeing the construction of over 171 schools as of 2010. CAI reported that these schools provide education to over 64,000 children, including 54,000 girls, in the remote regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, where few education opportunities previously existed.The book's title was inspired by a saying Haji Ali shared with Mortenson: ""The first time you share tea with a Balti, you are a stranger.

Three Cups of Tea remained on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller's list for four years.In April 2011, critiques and challenges of the book and Mortenson surfaced. Author Jon Krakauer alleged that a number of Mortenson's claims in the book are fictitious and accused him of mismanaging CAI funds. In 2012, Mortenson agreed to repay $1 million to CAI following an investigation by the Montana attorney general.

On July 20, 1950, Bussey was returning to his 77th Engineer Combat Company with mail from the states for one of his platoons, when he came across a dozen ""lollygagagging"" (resting) army truck drivers. Bussey heard fighting in the town ahead, in which Bassey states his company was supposed to provide back up support. He climbed a nearby hill. A kilometer to the rear of the vehicle column he spotted a large body of white-clad Koreans coming toward them.Bussey ordered the drivers to unload the two machine guns and ammunition in their trucks and drag them to the top of the hill.
I watched the group of farmer-soldiers coming ever closer and reckoned that farmers scatter and run if you send a long burst of machine-gun fire over their heads, but soldiers flatten out like quail and await orders from their leader...I sent a burst from the .50 caliber machine gun dangerously close above the heads of the approaching group...True to the form of soldiers, they flattened into the paddy as the bullets flew past them...Bullets raked and chewed them up mercilessly...The advancing column was under tight observation from somewhere on the mountain because large mortar rounds started...overhead.  I was knicked by a fragment.  the gunner on the .30 caliber machine gunner was hit badly, and his assistant was killed.  The enemy mortar was accurate.  The shells were bursting about twenty to forty feet overhead, showering us with shell fragments. And we were now drawing small-arms fire from the rice paddies below...I chopped the North Korean troops to pieces...I was ashamed of the slaughter before me, but this was my job, my duty, and my responsibility. I stayed with it until not one white rag was left intact.
The enemy unit was destroyed. Bussey's group was given credit for killing 258 enemy soldiers in the battle. A day after United States forces occupied Yechon, an Associated Press reporter filed a story about the entire battle and said it was ""the first sizable ground victory in the Korean war"".Bussey stated that he was denied the Medal of Honor in the battle because a racist white officer, Lt. Col. John T. Corley, felt the nation's highest medal for valor should only be awarded to a black man posthumously.Thirty nine years after the conflict, Bussey could not pinpoint the mass grave site of the dead North Korean soldiers and local civilians could not recall anything about the incident.The Washington Post states that ""prejudiced Army historians later insisted, against the evidence...[the Battle of Yechon]...never really happened"".",,,North America

<McOndo_(book)>,McOndo,1996,Spain,Alberto Fuguet and Sergio Gómez eds.,,Spanish,book,Grijalbo Mondadori,,,"McOndo is the 1996 literary anthology that spawned the McOndo movement.
Around 1994, Chilean writer Alberto Fuguet participated in an International Writer's Workshop which took place at the University of Iowa. There Fuguet attempted to present a short-story to the Iowa Review for publication. As the works of Latino authors were very popular at the time, Fuguet believed his chances of getting his works translated and published were quite high. However, upon reading Fuguet's work, the editor was convinced that the lack of magical realist or fantastical components in the narrative made it seem as if, ""the story could have taken place right there in [North] America."" Consequently, the story was rejected on the grounds that 'it was not Latin American enough'. In response to the rejection of North American editors, a short-story anthology was compiled dawning the title McOndo. Edited and introduced by Alberto Fuguet and Sergio Gómez, the anthology of new Latin American literature was first published in Spain in 1996. The work compiled 17 short stories written by authors, all of whom were from either Latin America or Spain. All of the contributors were males who had primarily commenced their literary careers in the 1990s and all were born after the late 1950s. The contributing authors distanced themselves from the magical realism genre as they believed it did not correctly represent modern Latin America, which in the 1990s was full of ""shopping malls, cable television, suburbs, and pollution"". Alternately, the authors wished to focus on the erasure of nations, borders and geographical identities as a result of expanding transnational networks while exploring the effects of globalization on economy and culture. In one essay, Fuguet railed against the picturesque, exotic stereotypes that the publishing world had come to expect of Latin writers, citing well-known Cuban author-exile Reinaldo Arenas's pronouncement that the literary world expected Latin American novelists to tackle only two themes: underdevelopment and exoticism. Fuguet wrote that he does not deny that there are picturesque, colourful, or quaint aspects to Latin America, but that the world he lives in is too complicated and urban to be bound by the rules of magical realism. In the end, the primary focus of the anthology was the introduction, which was considered to be more in the vein of an essay rather than a literary work.",,,Europe

Mansfield first published by Yale University Press in 2006. Mansfield is a professor of government at Harvard University. In this book, he defines manliness as ""confidence in a situation of risk"" and suggests this quality is currently undervalued in Western society.He suggests the quality is more common in men than in women, but doesn't strictly exclude women, for example he names Margaret Thatcher. He also suggests the quality is ""good and bad"", not all good, but not all bad. His main point is that gender neutral ideology denies both the reality of sex-specific qualities, and the valuable components of these, to the detriment of society.Mansfield attributes the rise of gender neutral ideology firstly to Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx and Jean-Paul Sartre, and then to feminists who repackaged the ideas as part of a political program.

The game's concept was developed by designer/lead programmer Sean Callahan, paired with an alternate reality 1930s America setting, conceived by VP of development/creative director Bill Davis. The player jets at high speed inside a grassy, enclosed sports arena on a rocket sled that is always in motion and chiefly steered with two grappling-hook guns mounted on its flanks. The rocket can change speeds but always flies about three feet off the ground unless it is engaged in one of the games' frequent and often-comic collisions.
The soundtrack features legendary surf rock guitar player Dick Dale. Three different Rollerball-style game modes are available for competition.
Although it was well-reviewed by critics, the game was burdened by a general lack of pre-release press coverage, steep hardware requirements, and extensive delays of a patch which added LAN play, which together led to poor sales. As time passed it has suffered a classic example of software rot and compatibility issues have appeared, making it very difficult to install the game on modern systems.

Set in the Wild West with steampunk and sci-fi influences, the story follows Annie and her bounty hunter Clint, seeking revenge for the death of her family. The player controls either Annie or Clint sidestepping and jumping in the foreground while shooting down enemy robots in the background and dodging enemy bullets. These gameplay mechanics combine elements from third-person shooters and light gun games.
Development lasted five months on a small budget with a team of only three core members and two support staff. The team leads had previously worked together on The Ninja Warriors (1994) for the Super NES, and so chose to develop for that system. Wild Guns was heavily influenced in its gameplay and artistic design by arcade games such as Blood Bros. and Dynamite Duke. The game's scenery, characters, and sound design drew ideas from the Western film genre and the science fiction manga Cobra, creating a space western setting.
Wild Guns received positive reviews at its initial release, and in retrospective reviews is considered a cult classic. Critics have praised the gameplay of what has become a niche genre, as well as the cooperative mode and graphical attention to detail. The game was rereleased on the Virtual Console for the Wii in 2010 and Wii U in 2014.

Doom 3 was originally released for Microsoft Windows on August 3, 2004, adapted for Linux later that year, and ported by Aspyr Media for Mac OS X in 2005. Developer Vicarious Visions ported the game to the Xbox, releasing it on April 3, 2005.
Doom 3 is set on Mars in 2145, where a military-industrial conglomerate has set up a scientific research facility into fields such as teleportation, biological research, and advanced weapons design. The teleportation experiments open a gateway to Hell, resulting in a catastrophic invasion of the Mars base by demons. The player character, Doomguy, an anonymous space marine, must fight through the base to stop the demons attacking Mars and reaching Earth. 
Doom 3 is the first reboot of the Doom series, ignoring the events of the previous Doom games but is stated in Doom RPG as a prequel to the first game. Doom 3 utilizes the id Tech 4 game engine, which has since been licensed out to other developers, and later released under the GNU General Public License in November 2011.
Doom 3 was a critical and commercial success; with more than 3.5 million copies of the game sold, it is the most successful game by developer id Software to date. Critics praised the game's graphics and presentation, although reviewers were divided by how close the gameplay was to that of the original Doom, focusing primarily on simply fighting through large numbers of enemy characters. The game was followed by Resurrection of Evil, an expansion pack developed by Nerve Software, in April 2005. A series of novelizations of Doom 3, written by Matthew J. Costello, debuted in February 2008.

The game was re-released twice in 2009. Firstly, by Boakes' own company, Darkling Room, in a limited ""Pins & Needles"" edition, and later by Iceberg Interactive, as part of their Adventures in Terror: British Horror Collection.

Encountering an ancient evil known as the Dark Fall, which traps souls between the realm of the living and the dead and feeds off their pain, the protagonist must attempt to imprison it before he too is overcome by its power.
Dark Fall received mixed reviews with critics praising the individual work put into the game by Boakes and finding the tone of the game unsettling. Common criticisms included poor graphics and an over-reliance on finding notes to progress the story. The game was followed by three further Dark Fall games.

When the Master Force destroy the homeworld of the Resistance and launch a full-scale attack, the Resistance deploy the Fighting Ray starship to destroy the Master Force and salvage what is left of humanity. Gameplay revolves around shooting enemies, collecting power-up items, and defeating each end-stage boss. It runs on the Namco NB-1 arcade system.
Designed by Hajima Nakatani, NebulasRay was part of Namco's experimentation with 3D video games during the 1990s. The game does not use 3D graphics, but instead 3D models that are pre-rendered as 2D sprites, creating a sense of depth. It pays homage to Namco's previous shooters, such as the Galaxian series, Xevious, and Starblade. NebulasRay is credited as being the first shooter to incorporate enemy artificial intelligence (A.I.). Prior to this, similar games used predictable enemy movements or pre-determined flight patterns. The soundtrack was composed by both Masahiro Fukuzawa and Takayuki Ishikawa.
NebulasRay became the second best-selling arcade game of the year, behind Super Street Fighter II Turbo. The game received positive reviews, with critics praising its gameplay, graphics, and technological accomplishments. One critic described it as being a welcomed addition to Namco's 3D arcade game lineup, and one that didn't put visuals over gameplay. Victor Entertainment released the soundtrack on an album for their Namco Game Sound Express series. NebulasRay has been recognized for its usage of enemy A.I., which has become staple in most mainstream games since.",,,

Created by Fifth Season AS in early 2000, then bought by Jolt in 2003, and then purchased by Renegade Games in 2009; it is now currently owned by Jagex. The game places players in control of a planet, with the ability to mine its asteroids for resources, enabling them to construct a fleet of spaceships to attack other players' planets. Although its popularity has declined with the emergence of other similar games and the introduction of a pay-to-play model, which has since been changed to a freemium format, the game is currently still active, and as such is one of the oldest running internet games of its genre.
The objective of the game is to attain a higher score than your opponents, which can be achieved primarily by stealing their asteroids and destroying their fleets. The game offers a player the choice between five races, each with their own types ships and advantages, allowing for a variety of strategies. Every few months, the game is reset, at which point winners are declared and a new round of play starts, commonly with a number of new features and updates to keep the gameplay balanced.
The game updates once per hour, which is called a tick in-game. Every action within the game, from the construction of a factory to the attack of another planet, takes a set number of these ticks, which gives the game a unique mix between turn-based and real-time gameplay, as it allows players only a limited window of time to react to other players' actions. Because of this, cooperation and communication between planets is a necessity, which leads to a strong sense of community play as the players organise themselves into alliances. As such, Planetarion has an active presence on the NetGamers IRC network for direct communication between players.",,,

The game combines gameplay, narrative and aesthetic elements from Atlus's Shin Megami Tensei and Nintendo's Fire Emblem series. It was released in Japan in December 2015, and worldwide in June 2016. An enhanced port for the Nintendo Switch, Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore, was released on January 17, 2020.
Taking place in modern-day Tokyo and featuring real-life locations such as Shibuya and Harajuku, the game centres around hostile beings known as Mirages who seek to harvest energy known as Performa from humans and are responsible for several disappearances. The story follows a group of teenagers who become allied with friendly Mirages, based on characters from the Fire Emblem series, and merge with them to become Mirage Masters. Under the guise of the Fortuna Entertainment talent agency, the Mirage Masters fight to protect innocent people from the Mirages and find out who is behind the attacks.
The game was first proposed by Nintendo producer Kaori Ando, who envisioned a crossover between the Fire Emblem and the Shin Megami Tensei series. Although initially reluctant due to their workload, Atlus agreed to the collaboration, and much of the early work went into deciding what genre of game it was going to be and how best to incorporate both series while creating an original game. The production period lasted five years. A notable feature was musical numbers produced by Japanese entertainment company Avex Group.
The game was announced two months after full development began. Its Western release retains the Japanese voice track with subtitles rather than an English dub. Reception of the game was generally positive; many praised the battle system, reactions to the story were mixed, and other elements such as dungeon designs and a lack of Fire Emblem-related elements were criticized along with technical problems. The game was later chosen by critics as one of the best games for the Wii U.",,,

It is part of the Donkey Kong franchise and follows the gorilla Donkey Kong as he sets out to defeat a series of evil kings and conquer the jungle. Jungle Beat is designed for use with the DK Bongos, a bongo drum-style GameCube controller previously used with the Donkey Konga series of music games. The player uses the DK Bongos to control Donkey Kong through various side-scrolling levels as he collects bananas, swings on vines, chains combos, rides animals, and defeats enemies and bosses.
The debut project of the 65-member Nintendo EAD Tokyo, Jungle Beat's development began around July 2003, after Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that Nintendo should commission a new Donkey Kong game. Development was led by director Yoshiaki Koizumi and producer Takao Shimizu, who sought to create a simple, accessible game in contrast to more complex contemporary games. Koizumi conceived a game that used the DK Bongos instead of a standard gamepad to control the player character, and applied lessons he had learned from previous projects during development. Because the tone differed from previous Donkey Kong games, the team chose to exclude most of the franchise's existing elements and characters.
Jungle Beat was released in Japan in December 2004, with Western releases following a few months later in 2005. It received positive reviews from critics, who complimented its use of the DK Bongos; they also praised its visuals and level design. Criticism was directed at its short length and low difficulty level. The team that worked on Jungle Beat went on to develop the critically acclaimed Super Mario Galaxy (2007), which notably retained and refined concepts that were introduced in Jungle Beat. Jungle Beat was rereleased as part of Nintendo's New Play Control! line of GameCube ports for the Wii in 2008; the port contains reworked controls and levels.

It was written and designed by Hideo Kojima and first released in 1988 for the PC-8801 and MSX2 in Japan. Snatcher is set in a future East Asian metropolis where humanoid robots dubbed ""Snatchers"" have been discovered killing humans and replacing them in society. The game follows an amnesiac member, who joins a Snatcher hunting agency in search of his past. Gameplay takes place primarily through a menu-based interface through which the player can choose to examine items, search rooms, speak to characters, explore a semi-open world, and perform other actions.
Kojima wanted Snatcher to have a cinematic feel, so the setting and story are heavily influenced by science fiction films, like Blade Runner, Akira and The Terminator. Development on the PC versions took more than twice as long as the average game of the time, even after Kojima was asked to trim more than half his initial story. The game was released to positive reviews, but poor sales. It garnered a cult following, and was remade as a role-playing game called SD Snatcher for the MSX2 in 1990. This was followed by a remake of the original adventure game using CD-ROM technology, released for the PC Engine Super CD-ROM² System in 1992.
Looking to provide a more interactive experience to gamers in the West, Konami developed a Sega CD version of Snatcher specifically for North America and Europe in 1994. Although it too was released to a poor commercial reception, the Sega CD version received mostly positive reviews for its cinematic presentation and mature themes uncommon in games at the time. Snatcher has been retrospectively acclaimed as both one of the best adventure and cyberpunk games of all time, and identified as a foundation for the themes Kojima explored later in the Metal Gear series. The game was a significant inspiration on Goichi Suda, who worked with Kojima to produce a radio drama prequel, Sdatcher.

Cells in the grid are organized into several streams of equal length, which often run diagonally and even branching.
