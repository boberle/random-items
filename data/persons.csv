Burbank resigned at the end of the war and joined the staff of the New Orleans Republican, where he first became known for humorous writing that was quoted in newspapers throughout the country.

The firm began as job printers, stationers, and manufacturers in 1862, when Tuer joined with Abraham Field (1830–1891), an established producer of registers and log books. Among their early successes was the invention by Tuer of Stickphast Paste, a clean, vegetable-based product that quickly became the standard office paste (and which was still being manufactured under new ownership as late as the mid 20th century).
Profits from this and other inventions allowed Tuer, the more adventurous partner, to pursue his publishing ambitions. From the beginning, the Leadenhall Press output reflected his imagination, curiosity, and interest in the full range of printing and book production techniques.
The Leadenhall Press imprint first appeared in 1872 in the firm's trade publication, Paper & Printing Trades Journal, as  'Ye Leadenhall Workes.' Field & Tuer occasionally printed books for other publishers and published sporadically beginning in 1869, but it was not until ten years later that the first official book in the Leadenhall Press catalogue appeared: Tuer's own Luxurious Bathing. The following year, Tuer launched the influential Printers' International Specimen Exchange, an annual survey collection of examples printed and submitted by printers and their employees.
Under Tuer's guidance, the Leadenhall Press became an innovative force during the 1880s, issuing as many as 40 books a year, including trade titles for as little as sixpence, as well as limited editions costing several guineas. Although perhaps best known today for children's book reprints, chapbook revivals illustrated by Joseph Crawhall, and several of elaborate productions of Tuer's own works, the Leadenhall Press catalogue included publications on a wide range of subjects for all tastes. Although the ""cheap editions"" of some titles could be plain and undistinguished, great care was given to the design and printing of many of the series books that were issued only in inexpensive formats.
The Leadenhall Press published many prominent (and also many forgotten) writers and artists of the time. Wilfrid Meynell acted as a literary advisor, writing and editing several books under the pseudonym 'John Oldcastle,’ and the Press published the first books by Jerome K. Jerome. Other authors included Andrew Lang, Egyptologist W. M. Flinders Petrie, Lady Florence Dixie (feminist sister of the infamous Marquess of Queensberry), Max O'Rell, Louis Fagan of the British Museum, J. A. Fuller Maitland, Grant Allen, and Count Eric Stenbock. Oscar Wilde appeared in the poetry collection A Book of Jousts in 1888, and his mother, Lady Jane Wilde contributed to the periodical Bairns' Annual.
The Press quickly earned a reputation for excellence in reproducing art; the first edition of Songs of the North (1885) included works by Burne-Jones, Whistler, and Frederick Sandys, among others. In addition to Joseph Crawhall, other artists who illustrated Leadenhall Press books included Randolph Caldecott, Georgie Gaskin, Tristram Ellis, William Luker Jr., and Punch cartoonists Phil May, Charles Keene and Linley Sambourne.
In 1892, after the retirement and death of Abraham Field, the company was incorporated as The Leadenhall Press, Ltd. Fewer books were published during the 1890s, but the quality remained high, often reflecting Tuer's antiquarian and collecting interests. Publishing operations ceased a few years after Tuer’s death in 1900, when the Press reverted largely to its original job printing and stationery business until 1927, when it was dissolved following the death of Mrs. Tuer. Between 1879 and 1905, the Leadenhall Press issued over 400 titles, not counting several different editions of some books.",00030.jpg,00030.jpg,Europe,Europe

The following year Escherich organised his supporters into the 'Orgesch' (from 'Organisation Escherich), an anti-Semitic paramilitary group. This new group quickly established links with the Heimwehr in Austria and gave weapons to the units commanded by Richard Steidle and Walter Pfrimer. Escherich was a close ally of Rudolf Kanzler, the leader of 'Orka', who was also close to the Heimwehr.The Orgesch was disarmed and disbanded on the orders of the Allies in 1921 as part of wider moves against the private armies that had sprouted up in Germany since the armistice. He returned in 1928 by founding a Bavarian Heimatschutz, a name also used by the Styrian Heimwehr of his ally Pfrimer, although this group was less significant due to the growth on the right of militia such as the Sturmabteilung and Der Stahlhelm, and was disbanded in 1933 when Adolf Hitler took power.",00060.jpg,00060.jpg,Europe,Europe

The records he listens to often inspire his work, and for Benner the creation of a leather jacket is an artistic process almost like the creation of a painting. He was initially inspired by the whole individual do-it-yourself fashion of the punk rock scene of the late 70s and early 80s. After seeing photographs of the era, Benner bought his first leather jacket thinking he could do it himself. He finally reached his comfort zone though trial and error.
Benner's designs have particularly sought by musicians and stylists for public appearances, performances and editorial shoots and can be seen on today’s top celebrities such as Kate Moss, Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Lenny Kravitz, Demi Lovato, Carrie Underwood, Miranda Lambert, Jared Leto, Ellie Goulding, Brandon Boyd, Taylor Momsen, and the members of 5 Seconds of Summer.

During his time as chairman of West Ham he was often portrayed as someone unpopular with West Ham fans. There were campaigns to remove him from his chairmanship and allegations of financial incompetence, during his chairmanship.A group calling itself ""Whistle"" was created by fans of West Ham United that were critical of Brown, following the club's relegation in 2003 and the subsequent sale of many of their top players. In April 2004, the group published a dossier accusing the board of financial incompetence, and asking questions regarding the club's finances. Brown and West Ham threatened to initiate legal action towards its members. Brown denied there was a financial crisis at West Ham and urged ""to ignore this nonsense and back our boys.""The group's aim was to seize control of the club and appoint a new management structure. But their attempts floundered as the existing directors retained the support of the club's major shareholders, the Warner and Cearns families. Legal proceedings were commenced against three members of Whistle. During 2004, two of the members submitted public apologies.
Brown's tenure as chairman ended in November 2006 with the sale of the club to an Icelandic consortium with businessman Eggert Magnússon as its chairman. Brown made £33.4m from the sale of his 7,392,000 shares in West Ham as part of this deal.In his final full season as chairman he received £1,016,847 comprising salary of £490,800, bonus of £310,000, benefits in kind £13,807, and pension payments of £202,240.On 13 August 2010, it was announced that Brown had acquired a small amount of shares from West Ham United's holding company WH Holding in conjunction with John Harris CBE and his son Daniel, known for building up the publicly listed Alba Group. Combined, their initial investment was £4,000,000. Brown is not on the West Ham board but is honorary life president.",00108.jpg,00108.jpg,Europe,North America

He is also credited as the author of several plays and music hall songs.
Laurence Hanray was born Lawrence Henry Jacobs in St John's Wood on 16 May 1874, the son of Angelo Jacobs (c. 1851–1910), a glass manufacturer, and Leah (née Nathan; 1850/1851–1946).His father changed his name to Angelo Jacobs Hanray, and with it the family name, after becoming bankrupt in 1897, although Laurence had been using the name Hanray professionally from at least 1892, when he appeared as a member of the Hermann Vezin Theatre Company in supporting roles in Hamlet and Macbeth at Her Majesties Theatre, Dundee.Australian newspapers show he was in Australia and New Zealand from around 1901–04, appearing as Carraway Bones the undertaker in the farce Turned Up at the Theatre Royal, Perth, in May 1901, and subsequently at most of the main cities until June 1904. Travel records show him departing Sydney for Auckland in August 1901, and sailing from Sydney for London on 7 October 1904. He then resumed touring in Britain. In the 1911 census, Laurence Hanray (36), actor, is listed as residing at the Woolton Hall Hydropathic Hotel, Much Woolton, Lancashire, England.Hanray married Dorothy Mary Chambers Farnsworth (1884–1918) in the Birkenhead district during the first quarter of 1914. She petitioned for divorce in 1917, but then died suddenly in London on 16 August 1918. Hanray married Lois Grace Heatherley (1892–1966) in Paddington during the same quarter his first wife died. Lois was also an actress and performed with Laurence at the Booth Theatre, Broadway, in 1921. They were also together in The Faithful Heart, she as Ginger and Laurence as Major Lestrade, at the Comedy Theatre, Haymarket. Travel records then show the couple arriving in New York in September 1922. He appeared in John Galsworthy's play Loyalties at the Gaeity Theatre on Broadway. They arrived in Liverpool in May 1923. The couple also played together in Escape at the Booth Theatre, Broadway in 1927, she as Miss Grace and he in multiple roles (the Fellow Convict, the Old Gentleman and the Farmer).Laurence and Lois had a daughter, Ursula Susan Edith Hanray, on 16 November 1923. According to travel records, the family visited America from September 1927. Laurence also went on his own to Canada in September 1931, and also during 1939–1940. Ursula became a child actress, playing the title role in the first televised production of Alice Through The Looking Glass in 1937, and the young Queen Victoria in a London theatre in 1940.Hanray worked almost up to his death; The Times reported in early September 1947 that he was to appear in a play at Dunfermline Abbey Theatre. He died at age 73 on 28 November 1947, following an operation at the Middlesex Hospital, London. Lois Grace Hanray died aged 74 on 25 April 1966.",00111.jpg,00112.jpg,Europe,North America

He has been a Visiting Scholar in the Department of Risk Management and Insurance at Georgia State University and in the Economics Department at Ecole Polytechnique in France for many years.
Georges Dionne has won the Kulp-Wright award (2002, 2015) for his book Handbook of Insurance, the Pierre-Laurin research prize from HEC Montréal (1998, 2003, 2009, 2016), the PRMIA award (2006), the Bank of Canada NFA Conference award (2006), an Honorary Ph.D. conferred by the University of Orléans (2006), and the GARP award at the Financial Management Association European Conference (2008). He is an Alumnus of Honor of the Faculty of Arts and Science of Université de Montréal (2008), and has been one of the 30 researchers chosen as part of the SSHRC’s celebration of 30 years of cultivating excellence in Canadian social sciences and humanities research (2008). More recently, he received the Innis-Gérin Medal (2011) for his original contribution to the social sciences in Canada and the Jean Guertin Award (2011), HEC Montréal's top prize for teaching excellence, for the support provided to his graduate students, and for having developed a new field of teaching and expertise at the School: risk management. He won the Marcel-Dagenais Award in 2012, the Roger-Charbonneau Award for the best book of the year in 2019, and was elected Fellow of the Canadian Economics Association in 2019 [1]
Georges Dionne has published extensively, including seven books on insurance and risk management and more than 170 articles in academic journals. He has been the Editor of The Journal of Risk and Insurance, and is member of the scientific committee for nine journals including the Journal of Risk and Uncertainty, (USA) and the Geneva Risk and Insurance Review (Switzerland), which named him the fifth most top cited author.
Georges Dionne led the team that developed the model for computing the Credit VaR model of a Canadian bank in 2001 and the model for computing the Operational Risk VaR of another bank in 2006. These two activities have important implications for the Basel international banking regulations. The two advance models of risk management allow banks to save capital by applying portfolio diversification strategies.
His research interests also include road safety. One of his main achievements was to propose (with Marcel Boyer) a new model for automobile insurance pricing based on drivers’ demerit points. This model was implemented by the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec in 1992 and is still used in Quebec.
In the insurance sector, Georges Dionne has collaborated on many projects concerning detection of insurance fraud in claims. In collaboration with the Insurance Bureau of Canada, he has conducted a comprehensive study to evaluate the significance of insurance fraud in insurers’ files in Quebec. More recently, with Pierre Picard and Florence Giuliano, he has developed an internal model for fraud detection for a large European insurer. This model was able to reduce insurance fraud costs by up to 40%. With his coauthors Pierre-Carl Michaud and Maki Dahchour, he is among the first researchers to empirically separate moral hazard from adverse selection and drivers’ learning using data on insurance contracts. He also has contributed to the economic evaluation of human life for public investment projects.",00119.jpg,00120.jpg,North America,Europe

Rideau was convicted in 1961 of first-degree murder of Julia Ferguson in the course of a bank robbery that year, and sentenced to death. He was held in solitary confinement on death row, pending execution. After the United States Supreme Court ruled that states had to rework their death penalty statutes because of constitutional concerns, the Louisiana Court judicially amended his sentence in 1972 to life in prison.
During his 12 years on death row, Rideau had begun to educate himself, by reading numerous books. After being returned to the general prison population, from 1975 Rideau served for more than 20 years as editor of The Angolite, the magazine written and published by prisoners at Louisiana State Prison (Angola); he was the first African-American editor of any prison newspaper in the United States. Under his leadership, the magazine won the George Polk Award and Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for its reporting, and it was nominated for others.
Rideau appealed his case four times. The United States Supreme Court and lower courts ordered a total of three new trials; the USSC overturned his conviction and ordered a new trial because of adverse pre-trial publicity. He was convicted again of murder two more times, in 1964 and 1970, each time by all-male, all-white juries. He served more than 40 years in the State Penitentiary; parole was never approved. In 2005 Rideau was tried a fourth time. He was unanimously convicted by the jury of the lesser charge of manslaughter; they did not believe he had planned the killing. Rideau was sentenced to the maximum of 21 years; as he had already served nearly 44 years, he was freed.
A Life magazine article in March 1993 referred to Rideau as ""the most rehabilitated prisoner in America."" He has written several books and edited compilations of articles. He participated in making two documentaries, including The Farm: Angola, USA (1998), about the lives of six men at Angola, including himself. It was drawn from his memoir Life Sentences (1992) and much of the film was made at the prison.",00142.jpg,00143.jpg,North America,North America

Born in Stockholm and the son of a merchant, his vocation for literature was assisted by his tutor, the poet Johan Magnus Stjernstolpe (1777–1831), whose works he edited. He entered the civil service in 1814, was ennobled in 1826 and received the title of baron in 1843. He held high appointments at court, and was, from 1834 onward, perpetual secretary of the Swedish Academy, using his great influence with tact and generosity. He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1836.His works include many academical memoirs, volumes of poems, philosophy and a historical study, Om Gustav den tredje såsom Konung och Menniska (5 vols, 1860–1869, Gustavus III as king and man), printed in the transactions of the Swedish Academy (vols 32, 34, 37, 42, 44).According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition: ""His poetry is over-decorated, and his plays are grandiose historical poems in dramatic form. Among them are Erik XIV (2 parts, 1826); and four pieces collected (1836–1838) as Dramatiska Studier, the most famous of which is the tragedy of Torkel Knutsson.""",00169.jpg,00170.jpg,Europe,North America

He began his career in advertising and his first commercial work, a sketch of his daughter, was bought by the Carnation Milk Co. and used on their magazine advertisements.
Montgomery continued to do commercial illustration for many years, and worked in many genres, but gained most of his recognition as a portrait painter and a muralist.  Montgomery was a prolific portrait painter and often used his family as models.  He was hired to paint numerous corporation chairpersons and executives, or those being recognized by companies, such as G.E. vacuum tube pioneer Saul Dushman.  He was commissioned by Sears Roebuck to paint a series of portraits of its founders and officers, and many of his portraits still are displayed in the Sears Tower in Chicago.  Montgomery painted similar portraits for companies such as Allstate and Motorola, and for heads of hospitals and universities.  Montgomery's most famous and most widely viewed portrait is probably that which he was commissioned to do of University of Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in the 1930s.  The portrait remains in the University collection in South Bend, Indiana. Montgomery also painted anonymous portraits, such as Woman with Mandolin, which hangs prominently in the guest house of Oprah Winfrey. Another notable work, a portrait of Motorola founder Paul Galvin, hangs today in the Crerar Library (now the Galvin Library) of the Illinois Institute of Technology.
Besides portraits, Montgomery gained national recognition for his large murals.  Sears hired him to paint murals for many of its stores around the country, typically showing scenes from local history. His first such mural was for a store in Houston in 1939. His last known mural, for Allstate Insurance in Chicago in the 1950s, depicted the history of the automobile age.  The unveiling of Montgomery's 70' mural of Mecklenburg County at the grand opening of the new Sears store in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1949, one of a series of 12 commissioned by Sears, was a major event, and when the store was eventually torn down, the mural was relocated to South Mecklenburg High School in 1970.
In 1942, Montgomery was featured in the Art Institute of Chicago's exhibition of prize-winning Chicago-area artists.
Some of his work is also on display at the Covenant United Methodist Church in Evanston.
Montgomery painted and taught until he was 85, working out of his home studio in Skokie, Illinois.",00179.jpg,00180.jpg,North America,Europe

He studied medicine at the University of Bern, and in 1876 was a general practitioner of medicine in Bern. He was interested in psychosomatic medicine, eventually gaining a reputation as a highly regarded psychotherapist. In 1902 he became a professor of neuropathology at Bern. Dubois was influenced by the writings of German psychiatrist Johann Christian August Heinroth (1773–1843). 
Dubois is known for the introduction of ""persuasion therapy"", a process that employed a rational approach for treatment of neurotic disorders. Within this discipline, he developed a psychotherapeutic methodology that was a form of Socratic dialogue, using the doctor-patient relationship as a means to persuade the patient to change his/her behavior. He believed it was necessary to appeal to a patient's intellect and reason in order to eliminate negative and self-destructive habits. He also maintained it was necessary for the physician to convince the patient of the irrationality of his/her neurotic feelings and thought processes. Dubois was disdainful of hypnotic therapy. 
Dubois has been described as ""the first significant modern proponent"" of a rational therapy or cognitive therapy, and for some time in the early 20th century it had competed in popularity with Freudian psychoanalysis, especially in the USA, but is little known today.His best known written work was the 1904 Les psychonévroses et leur traitement moral, being later translated into English as ""Psychic Treatment of Nervous Disorders (The Psychoneuroses and Their Moral Treatment)"". The preface of this book was written by his friend, neurologist Joseph Jules Dejerine (1849–1917). Another influential publication by Dubois was a ""mind over matter"" treatise titled De l'influence de l'esprit sur le corps. Dubois was also an editor of Constantin von Monakow's Schweizer Archiv für Neurologie und Psychiatrie (Swiss Archive for Neurology and Psychiatry).",00192.jpg,00193.jpg,Europe,North America

He was raised in Mexico.
He got his start in television at a young age, as a news editor for a station in Guadalajara. He went on to anchor the news first in Xalapa,Ver., Mexico for Channel 4 (TV_MAS) and later in the city of Veracruz, for the local Televisa Station.
In 1991 he began his career in Spanish-language television in the United States, first as co-anchor at  Univision and later at Telemundo as main news anchor.
A few months later, along with the news show, he started a new program “América Habla con Raul Peimbert,” a one-on one interview show that has allowed him to be one of the few Hispanic journalists that has interviewed more than 40 Latin American presidents, among them: Felipe Calderon Hinojosa (Mexico), Vicente Fox Quesada (Mexico), Carlos Salinas de Gortari (Mexico), Ernesto Zedillo (Mexico), Carlos Saúl Menem (Argentina), Alberto Fujimori (Peru), César Gaviria (Colombia), Ernesto Samper (Colombia), Eduardo Frei (Chile), Ernesto Pérez Balladares (Panama), Armando Calderón Sol (El Salvador), Rafael Caldera (Venezuela), Jaime Paz Zamora (Bolivia), Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (Bolivia),  Juan Carlos Wasmosy (Paraguay), Carlos Roberto Reina (Honduras), José López Portillo (Mexico), Miguel de la Madrid (Mexico), Joaquín Balaguer (Dominican Republic), Antonio Saca (El Salvador), Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua), Hugo Chávez (Venezuela), Leonel Fernández (Dominican Republic), Bill Clinton (United States).
His work goes beyond the boundaries of news; “America Habla” has allowed him to interview remarkable personalities such as Plácido Domingo, Rigoberta Menchú, Isabel Allende, Jacobo Zabludovsky, Carlos Fuentes, Joan Manuel Serrat, Elena Poniatowska, Mercedes Sosa, Oswaldo Guayasamin 
Jose Luis Cuevas, Alberto Cortez, and Facundo Cabral.
Other special assignments include all the visits of John Paul II to Latin America, the ongoing news coverage of the murdered presidential Mexican candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, the Los Angeles earthquake, the Federal Building explosion in Oklahoma, the terrorist attack on the twin towers in New York, the LA fires, the floods in the state of Tabasco, Mexico in 2007 and Hurricane Harvey in 2017, among others.
The National Academy of Television, Arts and Sciences has recognized Raul Peimbert with more than 35 nominations and 20 Emmy Awards. Among many other awards and recognitions, he received the “Crystal Apple”, in New York, for his work with the Hispanic community.
That same year in Los Angeles, California, Richard Riordan, the mayor, declared Peimbert “Guest of Honor” and in Mexico he received “La Presea de la Libertad de Expresión”.
In 1995, the Hispanic Council of United States of America, bestowed the award of “Don Quijote” in recognition of his extraordinary labor in favor of the Hispanic culture and tradition.
In 1998, he joined Radio Unica, a Hispanic Radio Network, where he hosted “Muy Temprano”, with his wife Fulvia Peimbert.
He also presented the news for MVS Noticias in Mexico City and eventually became the news anchor at Telemundo in Los Angeles.In 2002, he was hired as a General Coordinator of Media Affairs for the government of the State of Veracruz, Mexico. He gave up the position in 2004 after Miguel Alemán Velasco, the former governor, left the office.
From November 2005 to November 2011, Peimbert worked for Univision affiliate KMEX in Los Angeles as a primary anchor. In 2012 he took a lead anchor position at KXLN, Houston's Univision affiliate.
In 2007, the George Foster Peabody Awards has granted recognition to Raul Peimbert for his participation in ""Ya Es Hora"", a social campaign produced by Univision Communications.Peimbert has been married to Fulvia Camargo Peimbert since 1986; they have a daughter, Alejandra Peimbert.",00216.jpg,00217.jpg,Central America,North America

His work deals with taboos, embarrassments and achievements of the welfare state.
Samson lives and works in Rotterdam. Together with Dutch artists Tinkebell and Jonas Staal he is regarded as an exponent of a new category media artists.
By taking up distinct positions in the media, social issues are being broached. In Samson’s case, the artist distributes works that call for the rejection of the concept of sinfulness. According to some critics he takes a cynical stance, bearing resemblance to a right‑wing liberal argument.
Samson calls himself a ‘prosperity artist’ and argues for a re-evaluation of material objects. Within this context, he repeatedly refers to the duality of the vanitas theme in classic painting. Our lives would only be a temporary thing, and also full of spiritual and physical hardship. Basing himself on the Calvinist motto of ‘memento mori’ he propagates the idea that well-made products can help alleviate our earthly lives. In Samson’s view, even intellectuals should not hesitate to enjoy worldly pleasures.
This approach is expressed in performances, installations and photographs. He often seeks the collaboration of producers of luxury items and by making these sponsorships part of his art works he is challenging the boundaries of his artistic autonomy. Sponsors with whom Samson has realised art works include Bugaboo International, Smeg, Ketel One Vodka and Magimix.",00007.jpeg,00007.jpeg,Europe,North America

In 1881 Waren (often misspelt Warren) Tay first described the red spot on the retina of the eye that is present in Tay–Sachs disease. He reported this condition in the Volume I edition of the Ophthalmological Society, an organization in which he was a founding member. Here he described the symptoms in a child who also had neurological problems. Later in the Volume IV edition, he gave a complete description of the clinical symptoms of the disorder, and also reported that another member from the same family had this retinal condition.
In 1874 at the London Ophthalmic Hospital, Tay was the first to describe a condition that consisted of small white or yellow dots in the choroid around the macula in the eye, which are the manifestations of senile macular degeneration. Nowadays, this condition is sometimes referred to as ""Hutchinson's disease"", named after Tay's mentor, surgeon Jonathan Hutchinson.
Tay himself had glaucoma and was blind in one eye. He was a keen cyclist, and he was described by his friends as ""a walking encyclopaedia of medicine"".",00262.jpg,00264.jpg,Europe,North America

He has been described as one of the four men responsible for an escape from Bagram, on July 11, 2005. According to Eric Schmitt and Tim Golden of the New York Times, US officials didn't first identify him and Omar al Farouq under their real names, when they first escaped.
Schmitt and Golden reported ""Intelligence officials gave differing views on the importance of Mr. Kahtani. One official described him as having been responsible at one point for maintaining Al Qaeda's operational support structure in Afghanistan; another said he was an important Qaeda fighter, but not a senior-level operative.""
Al-Kaktani and the other three men were being held in Cell 119, Bagram, an isolation cell, with four other men.
Schmitt and Golden reported that it had been planned to transfer the four men to the Guantanamo Bay detention camps in Cuba.
Al-Kahtani appeared in a video released by al Qaeda later in 2005.Radio Free Europe reported that Al-Kahtani appeared in an al Qaeda video with the other escaped men in October 2005.American officials issued a statement on November 6, 2006 that a """"known al Qaeda operative and five other extremists"" had been captured in an operation in Khost Province.
On November 13, 2006, Asharq Alawsat reported that one of the captured men was a Saudi identified as ""Abu Nasir al-Qahtani"", who was later reported to be Muhammad Jafar Jamal al-Kahtani.
Xinhua reported that the men were captured with ""grenades, military equipment, armor-piercing rounds and AK-47 assault rifles"" and a ""camera containing surveillance video of nearby military installations"".
A Taliban spokesman told the News International that al-Kahtani was captured in a safe house near the Khost Airport.Al-Kahtani was extradited to Saudi Arabia on April 29, 2007.",00268.jpg,00270.jpg,Asia,North America

Impagliazzo has contributed to more than 40 papers on topics within his specialties.  He also stated the exponential time hypothesis that 3-SAT cannot be solved in subexponential time in the number of variables. This hypothesis is used to deduce many lower bounds on algorithms in computer science.

He was born in Paris, of a family consisting of generations of lawyers, and he joined the corps of the king's musketeers. He became fashionable for his work, Réponse d'Abélard à Héloise (""Abelard's Answer to Heloise""), and followed up this first success with a number of heroic epistles, Les Victimes de l'amour, ou lettres de quelques amants célébres (1776) (""Victims of Love, or Letters from some famous lovers"").
Besides light verse he wrote comedies, fables and, among other novels, Les Sacrifices de lamour, ou lettres de la vicomtesse de Senanges et du chevalier de Versenay (1771). He tried to cover his failures as a dramatist by buying up large numbers of seats for performances, and his books were lavishly illustrated by good artists and expensively produced, in order to secure their success.  Nevertheless, he managed to attract hatred both of the philosophe party as well as of their arch-enemy, Charles Palissot de Montenoy, and thus cut himself off from the possibility of academic honours.

Case, and O.J. Speaks: The Lost Deposition Tapes.The Hollywood Reporter touted that ""these projects promise unprecedented access into the criminal and civil trials of O.J. Simpson with never-before-heard recordings and interviews."" The films aired in over one hundred countries on the same day which was an unprecedented release strategy for A+E Networks.
Auerbach is also notable for his recent Executive Producer role on the Universal Music Release  Glen Campbell: Sings For The King (Elvis Presley) .  This music project features 18 never-before-heard recordings of Glen Campbell discovered by Stephen Auerbach.  The reel to reel tapes were lost for over fifty years and were made as demo recordings for Elvis Presley.  
Auerbach told Rolling Stone Magazine “Coming upon these tapes, unspooling them and watching them glide across an Ampex 440 reel-to-reel deck for the first time was the closest I’ll ever get to being a real life Indiana Jones. Beyond the staggering realization of what we had found, there was a musical element that also knocked our socks off: On these tapes Glen is singing pure rock and roll and with a sense of joy, passion and wild abandon that can only have come from knowing that his idol, the avatar Elvis Presley, would be an audience of one for these recordings.” .
Auerbach released Bicycle Dreams in 2010. Bicycle Dreams was a smash hit and one of the first indie films to be a social media phenomenon.  The film enjoyed a worldwide theatrical release, a very strong DVD market and won 17 Film Festival Awards.  Bicycle Dreams stands as one of the highest grossing independently distributed documentaries of all time.
Bicycle Dreams received rave reviews that often mirrored the intense themes in the film:
""Bicycle Dreams captures the human condition like few other films. This movie is not for those who want to shy away from the tragic side of human experience. Bicycle Dreams moves us to break through the barrier of the fear of death.""""The film is a ride of many stark contrasts; when it ended, I felt both shattered and triumphant. I realized I was experiencing its genius.""""As we fall deeper and deeper into Bicycle Dreams, what we witness grows more terrifying, yet more compelling. Auerbach's masterful direction exposes the raw lessons that drives people to push beyond the limits of human endurance. Revealing what lies at the heart of every impossible human endeavor is what Bicycle Dreams is all about.""""Bicycle Dreams is glorious and ugly and wonderful and gut-wrenching. It’s clear that Bicycle Dreams channels some kind of magic. It’s the kind of magic that makes crazy and insane dreams worth attempting.""""Bicycle Dreams is a film you must see. It's beautiful, thought provoking, exciting, emotional and scary. The experience of watching this film will leave you with a new perspective on life that will remain with you for a very long time to come.""Auerbach has also created over 150 hours of programming for major network broadcast, cable and syndication outlets, including ABC, NBC, FOX, A&E, LMN, TLC and DISCOVERY.
Auerbach’s feature documentary, Race Across America produced with Jim Lampley aired on NBC and received the highest ratings in the network’s history for an event of its kind.  The film went on to win the Grand Jury Prize at the Boulder International Film Festival.
Other films directed by Auerbach include The Circus Comes to Town, about traveling circus troupes of the Great Depression era, and The Memory Box, about a group of African social activists working to lift Ethiopia out of poverty and despair.
Auerbach's television work includes How'd They Do That (TLC) with sportscaster Pat O'Brien, World's Most Amazing Videos (FOX-TV) with Stacy Keach, I Dare You: The Ultimate Challenge (UPN) with Evel Knievel, World's Most Heroic Firefighters, (TLC) Totally Outrageous Love (ABC) with David Brenner, Road to Fame (FOX-TV), The Best of California (syndication) Whacked Out Sports (syndication) and In Search Of (FOX-TV) with Mitch Pileggi.

Weisman wrote 57 songs recorded by Elvis, which is the all-time record for an Elvis composer.  Amongst the Presley hits that Weisman wrote are ""Follow That Dream"", ""Got a Lot o' Livin' to Do!"", ""Rock-A-Hula Baby"", ""Crawfish"", ""Pocketful of Rainbows"", and ""Fame and Fortune"".
In 2015 Auerbach published his first book Why I Ride: Stories from the Road of Life.

The year of his birth is the subject of some speculation; some sources list it as 1829 while others claim 1830.
As the son of a famous concert pianist, Heller began his life as a musician studying at the Royal Academy of Music.  After becoming fascinated with magic at age 14, Heller began copying his idol Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, from whom he adopted his first name.  Heller left his scholarship at the academy to become a professional magician.
Heller's magic career began in New York City in 1858.  In an attempt to copy the style of Houdin, Heller wore a dark wig and spoke in a French accent when he performed.  His act was such a failure that he moved to Washington, D.C. to become a music teacher.
Heller married one of his pupils, the daughter of a wealthy Washington resident and would eventually return to New York.  Deciding to try his magic act again, Heller abandoned the accent and image of before and focused on the presentation of his illusions.  His tour that spanned from 1869 to 1875 became a success throughout much of the United States, Great Britain, Europe, and Asia.  Heller's success prompted fellow magician Harry Kellar to change his name as to avoid the impression that he was copying the greatness of Heller.
Heller retired from magic after his successful tour.  He spent the remaining years of his life performing piano in Washington, D.C.  In 1878, Heller died suddenly of pneumonia in Philadelphia, United States and was buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.",00027.png,00036.png,Europe,North America

He is considered Detroit's number one ambassador of art for world-renowned techno music artists. Haqq's artwork is featured worldwide on classic records by Detroit Techno record labels, namely the records of Juan Atkins, Metroplex, Derrick May, Transmat, Underground Resistance, Kevin Saunderson, Carl Craig.  Abdul Qadim Haqq has been serving the techno music community through Techno Visual Art since 1989. His artwork continues to inspire fans all over the world.Haqq, founder of Third Earth Visual Arts, bases his futuristic concepts on time travel. His love for fantasy art was inspired by childhood pastimes such as watching sci-fi and Japanese animation. ""Japanese cartoons were all I watched when I was a kid, like Speed Racer, Battle of the Planets and Robotech,"" says Haqq. ""I watched them constantly; I never missed an episode."" As a youth growing up in Detroit, Haqq was often sick from asthma and had to stay in the house, which caused him to spend a considerable portion of his time watching science fiction and fantasy shows on TV. These in turn led him to create and illustrate his own stories. Haqq majored in graphic illustration at the College for Creative Studies, originally called the Center for Creative Studies, in Detroit. After graduating in 1991, he committed himself to working as a futurist artist, and remains dedicated to Detroit Techno Art today. """,00313.jpg,00315.jpg,North America,North America

Upon his return from studying “proper dramatic technique” in London, he founded the Reduced Shakespeare Company, whose three-man farce The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)  toured the globe, played in London's West End for nine years, and has become one of the world's most popular shows.

While at WDI, Singer co-founded the Flower Street Players, an in-house theatre company for Disney employees, where he co-produced six plays, and starred as Snoopy in ""You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown"" – as well as serving as the show's director and designer.
Leaving the theme park business in 2000, Singer returned to writing for the theater.

Until October 2013, he was a design director in the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, LLP. During his tenure at SOM from 1995-2013, he created architectural projects in over 20 cities on five continents. Mr. Wimer is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. He currently leads AECOM's architecture practice in the Americas.
The majority of these designs are for large scale mixed-use programs such as Leamouth Peninsula in London, Cayan Tower in Dubai, as well as Greenland Group Suzhou Center and White Magnolia Plaza in China. Examples of other work include city planning as in the 93 hectare Marina Bay Master Plan, high-speed rail station design such as Tanggu Rail Hub, airport design as in Changi Airport Terminal 3, and industrial design projects such as the New York Standard Streetlight and door hardware for Valli & Valli SPA.Mr. Wimer believes that environmental sustainability and expressive structure help define the aesthetic of architecture, which can be seen in projects such as Zhengzhou Greenland Plaza. His projects have been published widely; exhibited at the Venice Biennale, Art Institute of Chicago, and The Museum of Modern Art in New York; and have received numerous awards, including three Progressive Architecture Awards. Mr. Wimer was featured on the cover of the inaugural issue of Architect Magazine in which he explained that his joy in being an architect is the moral obligation that goes into the project. He believes that it's gratifying to create something that affects people's lives on a daily basis. In his projects, he stresses the importance of exposing the site of a project rather than imposing on it.",00330.jpg,00332.jpg,North America,North America

Pratt had been a board member since 1941. One of his first jobs was to oversee the transition of managers from Charlie Paynter to Ted Fenton. Pratt moved Fenton into The Boleyn Ground several months before the anticipated end of Paynter's managership, to prepare him for the job. It was with Pratt's approval that Fenton, with Wally St Pier, set-up the youth teams and training methods which led to The Academy of Football and the establishment of training facilities at Chadwell Heath. In 1961 Pratt was responsible for the removal of Fenton and the appointment of Ron Greenwood. He retired from the chairmanship in May 1979, aged 74, after 29 years in the post becoming club president and handing over to Len Cearns.

His early films were produced in Spanish in Latin America, including Ropa Nueva para Felipe (1990) and ¿Con Quién Te Vas? (1995) followed by feature films produced in Africa, Asia, and Europe. These include the noteworthy Final Solution (2001) and Sabina_K. (2015), which was a finalist for Bosnia’s official entry at the 2016 Oscars.Early Life
Krusen was born Christopher Barron Krusen in Tampa, Florida, the son of Margo Sauer and aviation pioneer Bill Krusen. Krusen’s mother was from New Mexico of Hispanic descent and Krusen grew up speaking both English and Spanish. Upon matriculating at Harvard, Krusen majored in English Literature, intending to pursue a career as a novelist and poet. A growing interest in photography and the history of cinema, however, led him to simultaneously explore filmmaking as a possible future career.Eventually Krusen changed his major and schools, graduating from New York University (BFA, Film and Television) in 1976. He promptly started working with Tele-Tactics, a small production company making commercials and industrial films; other work in the New York film industry followed for several years, culminating in experience at both directing and producing.Career
In the 1980s, Krusen founded Messenger Films as an outgrowth of his work on Spanish-language productions for U.S.-based relief agencies and international Christian ministries. He produced his first dramatic film, Ropa Nueva para Felipe (New Clothes for Felipe), under the new Messenger Films banner.
In 1989 Krusen earned his MFA at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California and has steadily produced and directed films since.He is also an author and has written the books Undaunted for Tyndale Momentum and They Were Christians (Baker Books).Sabina K., Krusen's newest completed film, was shot on location in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and had its world premiere at the 2015 Sarajevo Film Festival, qualifying it for Oscar consideration in the Best Foreign Language Film category. In June 2016, Sabina K. won Best Picture and Best International Film at ICVM in Cincinnati, Ohio.",00358.jpg,00360.jpg,North America,North America

He is the leader of the punk rock band Porno para Ricardo.
Águila lives with his father in a small apartment in Marianao, where he also has been recording his songs with the band since they were forbidden to have concerts. His mother and sister live in Mexico. Águila has an 11-year-old daughter, Gabriela.Initially, his band was well received by the Cuban authorities, being even featured on television, but as his lyrics became bolder, he was banned from performing in public and the songs being put on the internet with help of a friend from abroad.In 2003, Águila was jailed on drug charges after a policewoman posed as a fan and asked him for amphetamines, after which he gave her two pills. He argues this was entrapment and an attempt to silence him. After serving 4 and a half years in Cuba's 5½ Kilo Prison, Aguila became an even more outspoken critic of the Cuban government, his lyrics growing more political. In an interview with CNN in 2007, Aguila said that ""Communism is a failure. A total failure. Please. Leftists of the world -- improve your capitalism.""  In an interview with exiled Cuban anarchists PPR described anarchism as being ""very seductive.""In 2007 Gorki featured in the documentary Cuba RebelioN, a film by Alessio Cuomo and Sander de Nooij about Cuban underground rock musicians who rebel against the Castro-regime. It shows the painful reality of musicians who are not allowed to express themselves publicly but are nevertheless willing to put their freedom at risk by playing their music.
In August 2008, Águila was arrested by the Cuban police with the charge of ""dangerousness"", which allows them to detain people whom they think they are likely to commit crimes. The charge carries a penalty of one up to four years in prison. Signs of a ""dangerousness state"" are habitual drunkness and anti-social behaviour. He was eventually ordered to pay a $30 fine for the lesser offence of public disorder, after prosecutors dropped the more serious charge.He has stated in an interview en 2008: “Capitalism is very problematic, as are Communism and socialism. . . . [F]or me, defending my anti-Castro ideas doesn’t mean an implicit defence of capitalism.”",00377.jpg,00380.jpg,Central America,North America

He is the author of three books, including The Book of Honor: Covert Lives and Classified Deaths at the CIA, which told the stories of previously unnamed CIA officers killed in the line of duty. His work has appeared in Slate, The Guardian, The Washington Post, National Geographic, Smithsonian, The New York Times, The Nation, NPR, GQ, and numerous other venues. 
Gup has been a prolific writer regarding doomsday scenarios and facilities to provide for continuity of government and the preservation of important assets of civilization, including the Mount Weather facility, as well as intelligence issues.
In the 1992 Washington Post Magazine article ""The Ultimate Congressional Hideaway,"" Gup was the first to reveal publicly  the existence of Project Greek Island, a large underground bunker at West Virginia's famed Greenbrier Resort to house the Congress of the United States in case of a nuclear attack on Washington, D.C., a revelation still considered controversial two decades after its publication. Those opposed to the revelation note that the exposure rendered the $14,000,000 ($123,382,792 by current standards) taxpayer-funded bunker useless and led to its decommissioning. Gup defended the story in a 2009 interview with Cleveland's Plain Dealer, arguing that the Greenbrier bunker was obsolete in 1992. ""We sat on the story for a couple of months making sure it wouldn't harm national security,"" Gup said. ""The bunker mentality that preserved that place was itself a threat to national security. It's exactly why you want an active press.""Gup, a 1968 graduate of Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio, was a reporter for The Washington Post and Time Magazine prior to his work in academia.  He was the Shirley Wormser Professor of Journalism at Case Western Reserve University before heading the journalism department at Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts and was a Guggenheim Fellowship recipient in 2003. He was also a 1980 recipient of the George Polk award in journalism offered by Long Island University. He shared the 1981 Gerald Loeb Award for Large Newspapers, and received an Honorable Mention in the same category in 1984.For his book, Nation of Secrets: The Threat to Democracy and the American Way of Life, published by Doubleday he received the 2007 Orwell Award. In this book he contended that the political culture was defined by a misguided desire for secrecy and was undermining the transparency of democratic institutions. 
His 2010 book, A Secret Gift, much unlike anything else he had ever written, chronicles the Christmastime 1933 anonymous charitable efforts of his Romanian Orthodox Jewish grandfather, Sam Stone, to help families in Canton, Ohio affected by the Great Depression.In the Michaelmas term of 2015 he was a Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University, where he was affiliated to the St. Cuthbert's Society SCR.",00441.jpg,00444.jpg,North America,North America

Furuli started his studies of New Babylonian chronology in 1984. He became a magister artium in 1995 and doctor artium in 2005. Based on his studies, Furuli has defended the religious views of Jehovah's Witnesses while a member of the denomination, including their view that Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians in 607 BC rather than the broadly recognised dating of its destruction in 587 BC. In a 2004 issue of Journal for the Study of the Old Testament, Lester L. Grabbe, professor of Hebrew Bible and Early Judaism at the University of Hull, said of Furuli's study: ""Once again we have an amateur who wants to rewrite scholarship. ... F. shows little evidence of having put his theories to the test with specialists in Mesopotamian astronomy and Persian history.""In 2005, Furuli defended his doctoral thesis suggesting a new understanding of verbal system of Classical Hebrew. In a review of the thesis, professor Elisabeth R. Hayes of Wolfson College, Oxford, wrote: ""While not all will agree with Furuli's conclusions regarding the status of the wayyiqtol as an imperfective form, his well-argued thesis contributes towards advancing methodology in Hebrew scholarship.""He has translated a number of documents from Semitic languages and Sumerian into Norwegian.In 2020, Furuli published a book entitled My Beloved Religion – and the Governing Body in which he maintains that the denomination's core doctrines and interpretations of biblical chronology are correct, but challenges the authority of the Jehovah's Witnesses' leadership. Subsequently, he was disfellowshipped from the denomination.",00040.png,00053.png,Europe,North America

Since 1234, Zürich had been governed by an aristocratic council. One third of the council's members were representatives of the nobility, and two thirds were drawn from the city's patriciate, consisting mainly of influential merchants. The city's mayor was appointed from among these by the abbess of the influential Fraumünster.
Rudolf was the son of Jakob Brun, a member of the city council, and of Mechthild. He was married to  Margaretha Fütschi, daughter of Ulrich, another councillor. Rudolf was himself a member of the council from 1332 to 1336.
Brun overthrew the former city council with the help of the city's craftsmen in June 1336. According to the new constitution, the council was now composed of 26 members, of whom 13 were of the Konstaffel, consisting of the former patriciate; at least seven of these were required to hold knighthood. The remaining 13 councillors were the guild masters of the city's 13 guilds (Zünfte). In this sense, Brun's reform was not so much a revolution as the creation of a balance of power between the patriciate and the guilds.
Brun reserved for himself the title of mayor for life, and he dominated the council until his death in 1360.
In 1337, Brun defeated his political opponents, who had retreated to Rapperswil, at the Battle of Grynau. In 1349, Brun led a massacre of the Jewish community of Zurich, seizing many of the spoils for himself. An attempted coup by the aristocratic opposition was forcefully put down in 1350, Count Johann II of Rapperswil, the opposition's leader, was arrested, and the town walls of Rapperswil and Rapperswil Castle were destroyed by Brun. Zürich under Brun joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1351.
A result of Brun's revolution was a decrease of the influence of the city's two monasteries, the Grossmünster and the Fraumünster, which had dominated Zürich throughout the Middle Ages.
The Fraumünster abbesses, traditionally women of the highest nobility, did retain considerable political influence, however, and the process was only completed with Huldrych Zwingli's reformation in the 1520s, in the course of which the monasteries were shut down.",00495.jpg,00498.jpg,Europe,North America

He left the company in August 2015.
Pennefather has gained acclaim despite several setbacks, including failing the annual assessment at the company's White Lodge school at 12, and 'being asked to leave' The Arts Educational School in Tring at 15. Pennefather continued his training in his home town of Maidenhead under Julie Rose, a former Royal Ballet member, and his tenacity saw him accepted into the Royal Ballet Company in 1999. He sustained a tendon injury as a soloist in 2002, and was out of action for 18 months. Upon full recovery in 2004 he was selected for the principal role of Paris in Romeo and Juliet by prima ballerina Sylvie Guillem, and Aminta in Sylvia by director Dame Monica Mason, which 'proved to be his breakthrough'.Pennefather's potential to enter the canon of great British ballet dancers alongside such greats as Anthony Dowell, David Wall and Jonathan Cope is closely coupled with the fact that his peer and pas-de-deux partner Ms. Cuthbertson is also British-born, bringing them progressively more attention as the next Anthony Dowell and Antionette Sibley in the British media.

Before becoming a professor in 1981, Meyer was employed in the newspaper industry for a total of 26 years, the last 23 with Knight Ridder, where he started as a reporter for the Miami Herald.

One of the earliest examples of computer-assisted reporting was in 1967, after riots in Detroit, when Meyer, on temporary assignment with the Detroit Free Press, used survey research, analyzed on a mainframe computer, to show that people who had attended college were equally likely to have rioted as were high school dropouts.

He took part in the Modoc War of 1872–73 in California, and is considered to have fired the first shot at the Battle of Lost River. On April 26, 1873, Scarfaced Charley led a victorious attack against a patrol of 63 soldiers. He killed all five of the officers in the patrol, as well as twenty others. It is widely written that he stopped the slaughter and told the soldiers, ""We've killed enough of you, now go home.""
After the execution of Kintpuash and three of his warriors for the murder of Major General Edward Canby and Rev. Eleazer Thomas, Scarface Charley was appointed by Colonel Frank Wheaton as chief of the Modocs who were to be sent to Oklahoma as slaves.  After a year in Oklahoma, Scarfaced Charley was replaced by Indian Agent Hiram Jones, as chief by Bogus Charley, partly due to the latter's better understanding of English. Other accounts hold that he was removed because he refused to accept that white people were ""true rulers"". 
Scarfaced Charley was also a gifted craftsman, designing an elegant typeface for the phonetic transcription of the Modoc language.

He was born in La Rochefoucauld, in today's Charente département. At the age of eighteen he entered the house of La Rochefoucauld as a servant, and in 1646 became secretary to François de La Rochefoucauld, author of the Maximes. Resourceful and quick-witted, he rendered services to his master during the Fronde, in his intrigues with the parliament, the court or the princes. In these negotiations he made the acquaintance of Condé, whom he wished to help to escape from the château of Vincennes; of Mazarin, for whom he negotiated the reconciliation with the princes; and of Nicolas Fouquet.
After the Fronde he engaged in financial affairs, thanks to Fouquet. In 1658 he farmed the taille in Guienne. He bought depreciated rentes and had them raised to their nominal value by the treasury; he extorted gifts from the financiers for his protection, being Fouquet's confidant in many operations of which he shared the profits. In three years he accumulated an enormous fortune, still further increased by his unfailing good fortune at cards, playing even with the king. He was involved in the trial of Fouquet, and in April 1663 was condemned to death for peculation and embezzlement of public funds; but escaping, was executed in effigy. He sent a valet one night to take the effigy down from the gallows in the court of the Palais de Justice, and then fled the country.
He remained five years abroad, being excepted in 1665 from the amnesty accorded by Louis XIV to the condemned financiers. Having returned secretly to France, he entered the service of Condé, who, unable to meet his creditors, had need of a clever manager to put his affairs in order. In this way he was able to reappear at court, to assist at the campaigns of the war with Holland, and to offer himself for all the delicate negotiations for his master or the king. He received diplomatic missions in Germany, in Holland, and especially in Spain, though it was only in 1694, that he was freed from the condemnation pronounced against him by the chamber of justice. From 1696 he fell ill and withdrew to his estate, where he dictated to his secretary, in four months and a half, his Mémoires, an important source for the history of his time. In spite of several errors, introduced purposely, they give a clear idea of the life and morals of a financier of the age of Fouquet, and throw light on certain points of the diplomatic history. They were first published in 1724.

Parents of the white children began to withdraw them. Prudence was a ""very obstinate girl"", according to her brother Reuben. Rather than ask the African-American student to leave, she decided that if white girls would not attend with the blacks, she would educate black girls. She was arrested and spent a night in jail. Soon the violence of the townspeople forced her to close the school and leave.Much later the Connecticut legislature, with lobbying from Mark Twain, a resident of Hartford, passed a resolution honoring Crandall and providing her with a pension.

The Hatfield family were Yorkshire gentry, originally of Ecclesfield, coming to own the manor of Thorp Arch in the eighteenth century through marriage with the Gossip family of that place.In April 1652, Hatfield became ill with a type of catalepsy. She became paralyzed, blind, deaf and mute. This lasted for seventeen days. When she recovered she began ""rambling"" about religious subjects and started quoting scriptures. What she said was documented by John and Peter, the songs of Edward Rodes, and another man named John Cromwell. On 8 September 1652 she became mute again. She remained mute until 7 December 1652.

As a young woman, Keetman was unsure of herself and of her calling in life.  In her twenties, however, she came under the ideals and music instruction of Dorothee Günther and Carl Orff at the Güntherschule in Munich, Germany.  This event helped Keetman to truly find herself, and she flourished in this environment. She began to teach at the Güntherschule after being a pupil for many years; however, the school was destroyed by a bombing in Munich when Keetman was in her early 40s. At that point, she and Carl Orff began the development of the Orff Schulwerk approach, for which she is best known today.",,,Europe,Europe

After receiving her doctorate in Clinical Psychology from Temple University, Ritterman is noted for her expertise regarding survivors of political torture and their families.  She is a prolific author whose work has been translated into Spanish, German, Italian and French.
One of Milton Erickson’s foremost students, Ritterman originated the concept of the symptom  as a trance state that is actually suggested by various people and social structures.  From this basic concept that Erickson himself admired, she framed therapy as the production of counter-inductions and hypnotic sequences that impact the symptom trance.
In recent years Ritterman has lectured nationally and internationally on using hypnosis in conjunction with family therapy and more particularly against socially violent governments and their abusive use of psychological methods and techniques.  She also lectures on the survival techniques of families experiencing torture.
Michele Ritterman lives in Berkeley, California and currently has a private practice as an individual, couples and family therapist.

This led to fame in educational circles, and ultimately to a string of books and speaking engagements. She was appointed to the Board of Supervisors of the Boston Public Schools, and paced by Governor William E. Russell on a commission to investigate the use of manual training in Europe.

She is Danish, born in Århus, Denmark in 1974, but lives and works in Sweden.

Her works vary from single squares of bronze, copper or brass, patterned and coloured by immersion in acids, or by having their aging process speeded up through natural and chemical means, to complex portraits made up of thousands of small squares, given individual patination by various processes.

Her use of multi-layering, juxtaposition and interlacing of copper foil with metal plate, is also an intrinsic part of her artistic process. Recurrent themes in her art are etched quotations from writers such as the Danish Karen Blixen and Hans Christian Andersen, art-nouveau reminiscent angels, and large letters, framed by waves of colours brought out of the metal itself.

Born in Belfast, Ireland, (modern-day Northern Ireland) Priscilla Stewart arrived in Shanghai in 1887 as part of The Hundred missionaries of the China Inland Mission and was one of a large party to arrive together. She was reported as being both Irish in her looks and in her spirit with blue eyes and golden hair. After a while in Shanghai she moved with three other women to work inland at the city of Ta-Ku-Tang.

Of her new-found calling she said,I am a missionary now, but I was not made that way. Had you asked me to come to a meeting when I was a girl, I would have said, 'No, thank you, none of your religion for me.'; for my idea of a person loving God was to have a face as long as a coffee pot.
In China, after praying whilst kneeling in the snow, she became seriously ill with a serious bout of pneumonia - so much so that she sent for her then fiancé Charles - who was himself recovering from an attack of pleurisy. After a while she started to recover but the local Chinese said that having sent for Charles from so far - that they must marry and Charles agreed! They went through a wedding ceremony with Pastor Xi Shengmo - who was unlicensed - but it pleased the locals. After their wedding the Studds moved to another inland city - Lungang-Fu.
Priscilla Studd was married to the English cricketer and missionary Charles Studd whom she met in China when she was a missionary with the China Inland Mission as had Charles as one of the Cambridge Seven under the direction of Hudson Taylor. The Studds were married in 1888 and had four daughters - Grace, Dorothy, Edith, Pauline; in addition two sons died in infancy. 
In 1894 the couple returned to England and then between 1900 and 1906 they moved to India. After India and another return to England Charles' missionary work took him alone to Africa and the last sixteen years of their married life was spent apart, with Charles remaining in Africa and Priscilla in England – here she laboured with the newly formed Worldwide Evangelization Crusade. She died in 1929.",00836.jpg,00839.jpg,Europe,North America

Working with her husband, the late archaeologist and theologian Kevin J. Sharpe, she spent 10 years developing methodologies to study finger flutings. Their work, building on the internal analysis concepts established by Alexander Marshack, was the first to be able to establish unique identities of cave artists through the study of individual hands and the application of 2D:4D finger studies. Their work on finger flutings was the first to show symbolic behavior by children in the Paleolithic through the creation of tectiforms in Rouffignac. Later work showed the role of women and children in the creation of cave art in Rouffignac. Their application of Zipf's Law from communications theory also gave the first replicable methodology for determining whether or not fluted panels represented purposeful communication or a proto form of writing. Today Van Gelder continues to research in Rouffignac and Gargas caves and lectures internationally. Her current research focuses on the role of children in both caves.

She was also the vice president of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, the world’s first feminist think tank.Wali said that her personal experience as a refugee of the Soviet-Afghan War inspired her fight for the human rights of uprooted populations. Her testimonies throughout her career before the United Nations, the United States Congress and the U.S. State Department led to the appropriation of millions of dollars supporting Afghan women-led NGOs and the participation of women in Afghanistan's nascent democracy.
She delivered the keynote address at the United Nations' celebration of International Women's Day in 2002, speaking alongside U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, First Lady Laura Bush, and Queen Noor of Jordan.
""For more than twenty years, I have waged my own jihad for social justice and peace, as the rights of my Afghan sisters have been systematically violated to the extent of rendering us as non-citizens in our own country. Afghan women have suffered heinous crimes against humanity, and need diplomatic and financial leverage from the international community to aid them in their fight to reclaim their rightful place in Afghan and international society."" -Sima Wali at the United Nations, 2002

Strecker is one of the original founders of UOL. Early in her career as a journalist, she was a writer and a co-editor with Lisette Lagnado of Arte em São Paulo, a magazine founded by the Brazilian painter [Paulo Baravelli] and dedicated to the visual arts.
Before starting her career in journalism and online media, Strecker was a music teacher and a performer. She was also a shareholder of Colégio Modelo, an Elementary, Middle and High School in São Paulo, founded by her father, Professor Nilo Campos Gomes (1923-1984).
At UOL, Strecker served as VP of Content for 15 years (1996 - 2011), leading a newsroom with almost 200 journalists, designers, coders and content strategists.

The tradition of making rag dolls in Mexico extends back to the pre-Hispanic period with the making of rag dolls reaching its peak in the 19th century. Allende's first doll was made when her sister was about to turn fifteen. For quinceañera celebrations in Xochimilco, it is customary to give the girl her “last doll” as a means of marking her transition from child to adult. Allende decided to make this doll herself, using sewing skills taught to her by her grandmother. Soon after, she began to make dolls for her friends and family, and the attention they received prompted her to think of selling them.
Allende started her own small business called Retacitos (Scraps) in 2002 involving other members of her family, such as her at that time husband Sinhúe Lucas, along with contracting various single mothers in her area to work. She sells directly to the public only on Saturdays at the Art Bazaar in the San Ángel neighborhood. Her other sales are mainly to stores and museums. She receives a number of custom orders including making dolls that look like famous people such as Frida Kahlo and even those that look like the purchaser. Allende states that her goal is to revive the craft of doll making but in a more modern form. She generally sticks to forms familiar to Mexican concepts of cultural identity such as lucha libre wrestlers, angels, traditional rag dolls, horses, mermaids, rabbits, etc. She has been recognized as an authentic Mexican craftswoman since 2010 by the government of Mexico City, her work has been exhibited in various museums and cultural events and has won the 3rd place at the VI Bienal Internacional de Arte Textil Contemporáneo WTA (2012) and the 1st place in the toys category at the Gran Premio de Arte Popular of FONART (2006) among other distinctions.",00982.jpg,00985.jpg,Central America,Europe

She was the first woman in the English North American colonies to appear before a court of the common law. She was a significant founding settler in the early histories of the colonies of Maryland and Virginia. Leonard Calvert, Governor of the Maryland Colony, appointed her as the executrix of his estate in 1647, at a time of political turmoil and risk to the future of the settlement. She helped ensure soldiers were paid and given food to keep their loyalty to the colony, thereby very likely having saved the colony from violent mutiny,  although her actions were taken negatively by the absentee colonial proprietor in England, Cecil Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore, and so ultimately she paid a great price for her efforts and was forced to leave the colony.With Anne Hutchinson, Brent ranks among the most prominent female figures in early Colonial American history. Hailed as a feminist by some in modern times in advancing rights of women under the laws, her insistent advocacy of her legal prerogatives as an unmarried gentlewoman of property, while notable in its exceptional energy, was consistent on paper with English law. However, in the rough, male dominated world of the colonies, her stance for her rights and her independence was unusual in actual practice and it would have been fairly uncommon back in England in that period.",00009.gif,00009.gif,North America,North America

She advocates for women rights, particularly against domestic violence. Born in 1945 in Fortaleza, in the Brazilian state of Ceará, Maria da Penha was a victim of domestic violence by her husband. She brought a case against her attacker to be condemned, first in the Federal Court of Brazil and later in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
On August 7, 2006, the president of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva put the Federal Brazilian Law 11340 into practice. Now known as the Law Maria da Penha, it increased the severity of punishment for domestic violence against women, whenever it occurred in a domestic or family environment. In cities with 60,000 people or more, domestic violence courts and shelters for women were established.  Penha says, “The problem is not the law but in its application. Unfortunately, these instruments exist only in big cities.""",01091.jpg,01095.jpg,South America,Europe

Her performances bring together a virtuosic command of her instrument, a penchant for improvising microtonal textures and melodies, and an array of percussive flute effects, all combined with electronic processing. These have distinguished her as “a pioneer in a wide array of new techniques”. Many of her compositions involve her own participation, though she has produced works intended solely for other performers, usually involving guided improvisation and electronics. She is known for her use of texts that form part of her compositions and improvisations. In addition to creating her own work, she regularly performs in other artists’ projects in a range of settings from modern chamber music to improvised electronic music.
While pursuing PhD research at the University of California, San Diego in the mid-1980s she formed a duo with flutist John Fonville, commissioning new works and exploring extended techniques on flute, particularly with regard to microtonal scales. She moved to Amsterdam in 1989, where she has lived ever since.
In 1999, together Steve Heather and Cor Fuhler, she founded Kraakgeluiden, a improvisation series based in Amsterdam, exploring combinations of acoustic instruments, electronic instruments and computers, and using real-time interactive performance systems. Many of the musical collaborations that have resulted have taken on a life beyond the Kraakgeluiden series, which ceased in 2006. La Berge’s own music has evolved in parallel, and the flute has become only one element in a sound world that includes samples, synthesis, the use of spoken text and electronic processing.
In 2006 - 2007 she collaborated with Dr. David LaBerge. This is a performance work based on Dr. La Berge's apical dendrite theory using film, narrative voice samples and music.
She performs on a set of quarter tone (Kingma system) flutes.
She can be heard on the New World Records, Z6 Records, Largo, Artifact, Etcetera, Hat Art, Frog Peak, Einstein, X-OR, Unsounds, Canal Street, Rambo, esc.rec., and Data labels which include recordings as a soloist and with Lukas Simonis, Ensemble Modern, United Noise Toys, Fonville/La Berge duo, Rasp/Hasp, Bievre/La Berge duo, Apricot My Lady, the Corkestra, MAZE and Joe Williamson.
She is an active artist in Splendor Amsterdam, a collective of 50 musicians, composers and stage artists who have transformed an old bathhouse in the center of Amsterdam into a cultural mecca.
Anne La Berge has regularly received funding from the Dutch Funds for Composers, the Funds for the Podium Arts and the Amsterdam Funds for the Arts. She is the co-director, with her husband David Dramm, of the Volsap Foundation. She also works as a freelance coach for the Amsterdam based Executive Performance Training company.",01120.jpg,01124.jpg,North America,Europe

At her first powerlifting competition in December 2011 it was obvious that she was a real talent and that she was going to be a great champion.

Her work has appeared at the Whitney Biennial (2004), and at major film festivals including the Sundance Film Festival, the São Paulo International Film Festival, the Palm Springs International Film Festival and the Hamptons International Film Festival. Her stories are often described as ""quirky"", with themes of love, isolation, and the delicate nature of relationships between young women commonly recurring. Her signature visual style often incorporates found or pre-existing media with rich, original material to create a unique, heavily stylized narrative result.
Her current project, ""The Promised Band,"" is a feature-length documentary about a group of women in Israel and Palestine who start a fake band as a way to explore their taboo friendships. The band is a metaphor for the greater society, with each character playing an archetypal role. The band struggles and fails for the same reasons the society itself struggles and fails, and when the women are able to achieve a modest triumph, the film posits that women in warring societies may be the key to peace. ""The Promised Band"" premiered at the Cinequest Film Festival in March 2016 and took home both the Award for Best Documentary and the Canon Filmmaker Award.
Ms. Heck's work has garnered a number of other awards and nominations as well, including honors from New York Women in Film and Television, the Iris Prize, Zurich's Pink Apple, the Short Movie Awards, the Provincetown International Film Festival, the Big Muddy Film Festival, and Newfest.
She has also worked as a shooter and producer at networks including MTV, VH1, G4/TechTV, Current TV, and Bravo. She has shadow directed on Showtime's Dexter (with Steve Shill) and TNT's Leverage (with Rod Hardy.)
In 2008, Heck traveled to the tallest peak in the world, Mount Everest, where she lived with a professional climbing team as part of her research for an upcoming feature film.
